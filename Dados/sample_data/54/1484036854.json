This is the largest quarterly drop in confidence since the survey began in 2011,\u201d the survey found.\n\n\u201cThe result is also the first time that confidence levels have been below neutral since December 2012.\u201d\n\nAmong the questions the survey asked was \u201cover the next 12 months in the state you primarily operate, how do you expect capital values to change for residential\u201d.\n\nThe results were shocking with Queensland emerging with the least of the terrible results in the 12-month ahead capital growth expectations index, notching a -20 point fall. Every other state and territory expected even worse than that.\n\nTaken before and during the coronavirus emergency, Property Council Queensland executive director, Chris Mountford, said there was no other way to put it, given all sectors were impacted by the global crisis.\n\n\u201cYou cannot sugar-coat the level of concern out there in the property industry about the economic impact of the coronavirus. Across Australia we\u2019ve recorded a significant fall in growth expectations as the entire economy braces for impact.\u201d\n\nBut he warned that if real estate and construction was to help lead the way out for the economic recovery, tax breaks would be necessary.\n\n\u201cThe industry is hoping for a quick recovery and to ensure this occurs it is critical that the pipeline of future projects continues to flow uninterrupted despite the crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the medium to longer term further stimulus measures will be necessary to restore confidence.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW SOPHIE FOSTER ON FACEBOOK", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["The Block News"], "authors": ["Sophie Foster"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Coronavirus has done what elections, oversupply and the mining bust could not, breaking property confidence to its lowest point since 2011 \u2013 and prices could follow, the latest Big Four Bank survey warns.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Coronavirus has done what elections, oversupply and the mining bust could not, breaking property confidence to its lowest point since 2011 \u2013 and prices could follow, the latest Big Four Bank survey warns.", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/news/coronavirus-survey-fears-house-values-could-fall-after-record-drop-in-confidence/", "title": "Coronavirus: Survey fears house values could fall after record drop in confidence - realestate.com.au", "description": "Coronavirus has done what elections, oversupply and the mining bust could not, breaking property confidence to its lowest point since 2011 \u2013 and prices could follow, the latest Big Four Bank survey warns.", "image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/images/1024x768-fit,progressive/2020/04/16050020/capi_dadcd5cc41b26563d5b48cfa335ad625_d629697c8f9cd570bf142ca4664e28c5.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@realestate_au", "creator": "@RealMattBell", "title": "Coronavirus: Survey fears house values could fall after record drop in confidence - realestate.com.au", "description": "Coronavirus has done what elections, oversupply and the mining bust could not, breaking property confidence to its lowest point since 2011 \u2013 and prices could follow, the latest Big Four Bank survey warns.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/images/1024x768-fit,progressive/2020/04/16050020/capi_dadcd5cc41b26563d5b48cfa335ad625_d629697c8f9cd570bf142ca4664e28c5.jpeg", "alt": "Brisbane Aerial Panorama, Queensland, Australia"}}, "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.realestate.com.au/news/coronavirus-survey-fears-house-values-could-fall-after-record-drop-in-confidence/"}
