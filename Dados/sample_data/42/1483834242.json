I watched some of you have good nights and some bad nights but what was consistent every night was that you care for people. Today I leave this ICU a changed person, hopefully for the better, not only because of your medical healing and God\u2019s direction and guidance, but with the fact of knowing that there are such wonderful people dedicated to the care and concern of others.
