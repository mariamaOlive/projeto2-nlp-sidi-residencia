Britain's central bank is looking into timely and targeted measures to try and help small- and medium-sized businesses and is also coordinating with Treasury, putting \"major emphasis above and below\" Wednesday's policy action.\n\nHe believes the U.S. urgently needs \"a whole of government approach\" that first examines what the most vulnerable parts of society are and where the systemic risk lies, then plays defense on that.\n\nWashington should also play offense by promoting sustainable growth and taking the lead in terms of global coordination, he said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde said a failure by the region's leaders to act could produce a \"scenario that will remind many of us of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis,\" according to Bloomberg.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe European Central Bank is scheduled to meet on Thursday, and is widely expected to match the rate cuts made by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England.
