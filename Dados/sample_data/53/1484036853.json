No cases have been detected since 2004.\n\nBut if the two viruses are so similar, why was SARS so limited in its spread in contrast to COVID-19? The answer may be two-fold.\n\nThe study found COVID-19 survived on surfaces longer than SARS.\n\nScientists could detect COVID-19 in the air up to three hours after it was introduced, up to four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, 48 hours on stainless steel, and up to 72 hours on plastic surfaces.\n\nSource: The New England Journal of Medicine\n\nIn addition, the study suggests COVID-19 has greater success in spreading because carriers may be asymptomatic or they may not recognize the symptoms quickly enough.\n\nAs always, the NIH and other healthcare professionals are advising the public to develop and maintain good, safe habits to combat the spread of coronavirus:\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth\n\nStay home when you are sick\n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "national"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kevin S.
