But that doesn\u2019t mean investors are out of the woods just yet, after having endured a 26.7 percent drop from the Feb. 19 peak.\n\nGOLD DROPS BUT STILL HAS LUSTER LONG TERM\n\n\u201cI wish I could tell you that I see calmer waters in front of us, but I do not,\u201d Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz Global Investors, told FOX Business\u2019 Liz Claman after Thursday\u2019s closing bell. \u201cWaters are going to get even choppier.\"\n\nThe turmoil will be driven by the sudden economic disruption from the coronavirus as well as transactions forced by market conditions that haven't been completed yet.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of trapped longs,\" El-Erian said. \"You have a lot of redemptions going on from ETFs and going on from mutual funds. So I'm afraid it's going to get even more treacherous in the next few days and weeks.\u201d\n\nStock-market bottoms do not happen overnight.\n\nThe S&P 500 took 101 trading days to bottom after former President George W. Bush signed the Troubled Asset Relief Program on Oct. 3, 2008, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Along the way, the index staged several double-digit percentage rallies and declines before ultimately putting in a bottom on March 9, 2009, and starting the longest bull market in history.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cThis road can be very short if we find a way quickly of containing the virus and of increasing immunity,\u201d El-Erian said. \u201cA vaccine would do it. I don't think, unfortunately, that's going to happen in the next few weeks, so I think we are going to see further economic, financial and technical pressures on markets.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The S&P 500 took 101\u00a0trading days to bottom after former President George W.
