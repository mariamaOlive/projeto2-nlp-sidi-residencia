How am I still on this stage with them?\u201d\n\nYang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who has never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.\n\nAs funny as Yang\u2019s line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.\n\nIt is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in The Atlantic, \u201ca spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous.\u201d It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don\u2019t want.\n\nNo wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country\u2019s history. \u201cThe victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process,\u201d political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, \u201cand a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination \u2014 the most important thing that U.S. political parties have.\u201d\n\nThe current system may seem as if it\u2019s simply an expression of democracy, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s one version of democracy. And it\u2019s one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.\n\nToday\u2019s leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and Andr\u00e9 Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.\n\nHow could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee \u2014 as with primaries here \u2014 only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We\u2019re left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30% of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.\n\nA better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.\n\nThe first change should be to the debates. The candidates\u2019 electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4% in a few polls.\n\nIt makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.\n\nA second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.\n\nRanked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn\u2019t back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.\n\nIt\u2019s also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn\u2019t give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.\n\nThe seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s \u2014 and no African American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election \u2014 and zero who have ever run a state.\n\nOf course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn\u2019t any of those seven.
