Of those, 12 have come back negative,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nHe added: \u201cFour samples from New York City and five samples from New York State outside of New York City are pending, for nine total pending samples.\u201d\n\nNew York City will soon able to test coronavirus by itself, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nIn a tweet on Feb. 5, the mayor wrote the city is \u201cone step closer\u201d to be capable of testing coronavirus samples.\n\nWe\u2019re one step closer to being able to test coronavirus samples in New York City.

We\u2019re pushing to speed up this process. \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) February 6, 2020\n\n\u201cThe CDC has given localities the tools, but we still need our labs to be granted the authority.
