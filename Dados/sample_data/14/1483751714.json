The government's wage subsidy applies to 1.9 million local employees.\n\nFurther, foreign worker levy for the month of April is waived.\n\nAll adult Singaporeans will receive S$300 cash payout on the top of S$300 payment announced earlier.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\n\nForex News", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Singapore", "Stimulus Package", "Heng Swee Keat", "coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Singapore stimulus package", "Singapore economic stimulus"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Singapore announced an additional S$5.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) stimulus to save jobs and protect the livelihoods of people amid the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Singapore Announces S$5.1 Bln Additional Stimulus On Covid-19 Shock", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rttnews.com/3084000/singapore-announces-s-5-1-bln-additional-stimulus-on-covid-19-shock.aspx", "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/forextopstory/2020/april/singapore-jan07_06apr20-lt.jpg", "site_name": "RTTNews"}, "fb": {"admins": 1534781310, "app_id": 164833610221655}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "Singapore, Stimulus Package, Heng Swee Keat, coronavirus, COVID-19, Singapore stimulus package, Singapore economic stimulus", "description": "Singapore announced an additional S$5.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) stimulus to save jobs and protect the livelihoods of people amid the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.", "Googlebot-News": "noindex, nofollow", "news_keywords": "Singapore, Stimulus Package, Heng Swee Keat, coronavirus, COVID-19, Singapore stimulus package, Singapore economic stimulus"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.rttnews.com/3084000/singapore-announces-s-5-1-bln-additional-stimulus-on-covid-19-shock.aspx"}
