SARS-CoV-1 is the human coronavirus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2, according to the study.\n\nIn the stability study the two viruses behaved similarly, which unfortunately fails to explain why COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.\n\nThe research attempted to mimic virus being deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects. The scientists then investigated how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces.\n\nThe findings affirm the guidance from public health professionals to use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick; avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth; staying home when people are sick; covering cough or sneeze with a tissue; and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\nThe study was jointly carried out by scientists from the NIH, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Princeton University.\n\n\u2013IANS\n\nbu/sdr/", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["coronavirus", "surfaces", "stable", "novel", "study", "hours"], "authors": ["Canindia New Wire Service", "Author"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 17 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CINEWS-ICON1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"title": "Novel coronavirus stable for hours on surfaces: Study", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.canindia.com/novel-coronavirus-stable-for-hours-on-surfaces-study/", "site_name": "Canindia News", "description": "New York, March 18 (IANS) The virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, which has claimed over 7,000 lives globally, can be stable for several hours to days in ae", "image": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AVTAR_CI2019-1.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Novel coronavirus stable for hours on surfaces: Study", "description": "New York, March 18 (IANS) The virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, which has claimed over 7,000 lives globally, can be stable for several hours to days in ae", "image": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AVTAR_CI2019-1.png"}, "author": "CanIndia New Wire Service", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.5", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.canindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CINEWS-ICON1-270x270.png"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.canindia.com/novel-coronavirus-stable-for-hours-on-surfaces-study/"}
