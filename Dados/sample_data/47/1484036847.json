We have no reliable idea of how many people in the United States have coronavirus because we cannot widely test, but as of press time, at least 38 people have died, and the global death rate appears far worse than the seasonal flu\u2014the most recent estimate is as high as 3.4 percent compared with 0.1 percent for the flu.\n\nHere are some of the challenges we face as a result of bad decisionmaking on the part of the U.S. government\u2014and the small things you as an individual can do to protect yourself.\n\nPlanning for a pandemic should have happened years ago and didn't\n\nWhat is the best way to respond to coronavirus? \u201cThe solution is aggressive preparedness,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a press conference on March 5.\n\nThat\u2019s...not what we did. \u201cI think we are building the ship as it sails,\u201d said Carlos del Rio, professor of medicine and global health at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe Trump administration has effectively made any disease outbreak worse than it needs to be. While most of their death-wish budget cuts haven\u2019t been enacted\u2014they tried their best in 2018 to burn $252 million set aside from the Ebola response and to reduce global epidemic prevention efforts by 80 percent\u2014the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s public health emergency preparedness grants are 36 percent lower this year than in 2002, and the CDC overall has 10 percent less funding than it did 10 years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the people who might deliver us from coronavirus, skilled scientists, are in shorter and shorter supply\u20141,600 federal scientists lost their jobs in Trump\u2019s first 18 months\u2014and Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be listening to the ones who have served multiple presidential administrations.\n\nInstead, the person with whom we are told to place our faith is Mike Pence, the vice president who prayed on needle exchanges during an HIV outbreak instead of implementing them right away and refuses to be alone in a room with a woman (you know, like the White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator), which may help explain why to get a seat at the table it appears one need not a PhD but a Y chromosome.\n\nCombine the lack of funding with a lack of people who know what they\u2019re doing and we\u2019ve basically turned the United States into a petri dish for a pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe cuts to the CDC have really left us in a precarious situation,\u201d explained Kimberley Shoaf, a public health professor at the University of Utah.\n\nThis means even smart, compassionate health professionals have little idea what\u2019s happening. Compare the situation today with what happened during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, or the \"swine flu.\" While Shoaf explained that the CDC held regular Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) calls for clinicians during H1N1, zero calls were held during the month of February. \u201cThe entire month of February we should have been getting things up to speed,\u201d Shoaf said.\n\nWhat you can do: Prepare, but do not panic. There is a good chance you will get COVID-19, according to reporting by James Hamblin at The Atlantic; 40 to 70 percent of people are likely to be infected, though how badly varies widely. Even scarier, Liz Specht did the math for STAT News on how quickly the healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and there\u2019s a good chance all hospital beds in the United States will be full sometime in May.\n\nUnless you are someone with the authority to hire scientists or ramp up production of ventilators and viral RNA isolation kits, wash your hands with soap or sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol, as per the CDC. There is no need to dig a doomsday bunker, but stock up with what you might need to stay home comfortably for two weeks (more on another suggested activity, calling your Congressperson, below).\n\nTesting is far from what it should be\n\nThe ability to test people in the United States\u2014something epidemiologists have called \u201cnot a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses\u201d\u2014has been flawed or nonexistent. Last Monday the Trump administration said that \u201cclose to a million tests will be able to be performed\u201d by the end of the week. But then the number of tests disappeared from the CDC website and The Atlantic reported that only 1,895 have actually been done; as of March 9, the number was 4,384.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was coming like we know a hurricane is coming,\u201d said Wendy Parmet, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University. \u201cWe should have been ready to go just like South Korea.\u201d South Korea has tested more than 195,000 people so far.\n\nWhat this means is that we know far less than we should about who is sick, where they are, and how to help them\u2014and this puts all of us at risk.\n\n\u201cI suspect there is community transmission happening in a lot of places,\u201d said Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cRight now, patients aren't tested unless they are hospitalized, so we may be missing milder cases of the disease, which can spread the virus in the community.\u201d\n\nWhat you can do: It's time to practice social distancing, or what the CDC defines as staying away from \"congregate settings\" (aka crowded public places like shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums), avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. So, if it is possible for you to avoid the crowded subway commute and work from home, you can play a vital role in slowing down or interrupting pathways that allow the virus to spread.\n\nSince it is unclear how much disease there is (something robust testing could tell us), we ought to avoid large groups, even religious services, if we can. \u201cUse common sense and avoid non-essential group gatherings where people may or may not know they are sick,\u201d advised Sandra Springer, an infectious diseases doctor at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s health depends on everybody else\u2019s health,\u201d Parmet said. Remember: we are not only social distancing and washing our hands for ourselves, but for the health of people around us for whom the virus could be serious, like the elderly and people with disabilities and compromised immune systems.\n\nThe administration appears to be acting in its own self-interest\n\n\u201cMy main concern is that the leadership of this country is much more concerned about their own self image than collective well being,\u201d said Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nWith his patented loves-to-talk-hates-to-read energy, Donald Trump \u2014who has said the moon is part of Mars, vaccines cause autism, and fracking is harmless\u2014has repeatedly taken his sharpie to revise the WHO\u2019s mortality rate for coronavirus, saying it is a \u201cfraction of 1 percent\u201d when the WHO estimates 3.4 percent, and speed up the timeline for a vaccine, saying \u201ca couple of months\u201d when in fact it will take between 12 and 18 months.\n\nTrump has repeatedly put CDC Director Robert Redfield in the awkward position of correcting his lies. On January 22, Trump said everything is under control; Redfield was forced to admit \u201cit\u2019s definitely not controlled.\u201d Then, Trump said \u201cthe heat kills this kind of virus\u201d and soon \u201cthe rough stuff\u201d would be gone; Redfield had to clarify that the virus is likely here to stay beyond this year. And a month after Trump said everything was under control, he said the first person to die from coronavirus in the US was a woman; Redfield had to again correct him that the first death was a man.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s flexes are sometimes funny like eavesdropping on a bad date is funny\u2014\u201cAll these doctors say, 'how do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability\u201d is something he really said\u2014during a pandemic we need a calm voice who is concerned with something other than airing grievances or downplaying health risks to prop up his re-election chances. (One poll suggests he is hurt by his handling of the pandemic.)\n\n\u201cOne of the most important aspects of controlling an epidemic is public trust, and the administration must be transparent and clear in its communication with the public,\u201d Buckee said. \u201cRight now, it doesn't seem as if that transparency is a priority, and the politicization by the administration of what is actually a public health crisis is extremely problematic.\u201d\n\nWhat you can do: Listen to the scientists, such as Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been brave enough to deliver bad news (\u201cWe have got to assume it is going to get worse and worse and worse,\u201d Fauci told Congress on Wednesday), and health activists, such as Yale epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves, who have been on the frontlines of epidemics in the United States for more than 30 years. Assume anything rosy-sounding coming out of Trump's mouth right now probably isn\u2019t true.\n\nRepublicans may try to pin the blame on people of color (again)\n\n\u201cA public health issue requires a collective response,\u201d Reardon said. But a collective response is fundamentally at odds with the project of the Trump administration and Republicans more generally, which might see the pandemic as too good an opportunity to let go to waste.\n\n\u201cWe should worry about disaster authoritarianism\u2014a reason to implement some of the more draconian policies that Trump wanted to implement anyway,\u201d Reardon said.\n\nJust last week, Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country\u201d and mocked \u201cfringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open.\u201d While China engaged in an aggressive and controversial quarantine to put coronavirus in check, Trump tweeting Tuesday that \u201cwe need the Wall more than ever\u201d clearly serves zero public health purpose. What we have now is community spread within the U.S.\u2014that is, international travel and immigration isn\u2019t the issue.\n\nNevertheless, on Monday, GOP House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy called the virus \u201cthe Chinese coronavirus\u201d; Turning Point USA\u2019s Charlie Kirk likewise tweeted about \u201cChina virus.\u201d Even outlets like The Washington Post are unfortunately playing into racializing the disease with a social media post that depicts a group of mask-wearing Asian people under the head \u201cHealth officials warn that the spread of coronavirus in the US appears inevitable.\u201d And, earlier this week, a man on a train in Brooklyn sprayed Febreze at an Asian passenger; an SUV in Fresno was vandalized with \u201cFuck Asions and Coronyvirus.\u201d\n\nYet the real culprits in what is making coronavirus spread and kill more viciously than it should are not people with some connection to where the disease first took off, but rather they are the nation\u2019s lack of preparation for health crises, large and small.\n\n\u201cThe fact that low-income communities may not be able to take measures like working from home, or may have no income if they take sick leave or self-quarantine, not only leaves them more vulnerable to the virus, it also means that the population as a whole is more exposed to the epidemic,\u201d Buckee said. \u201cThe erosion of public health support and financing has left us very vulnerable to epidemics like this.\u201d\n\nWhat you can do: While the administration continues to bungle the response and look out for themselves, people should look out for each other\u2014and call your members of Congress.\n\nIf you want to know what to ask for, check out the recommendations in this open letter from Yale\u2019s Global Health Justice Partnership, which has been signed by more than 800 public health and human rights experts: People need to be able to afford care, immigration enforcement should be suspended at clinics and hospitals, and people who cannot afford to practice social distancing need sick pay and emergency cash.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are risk-averse in the best of times, in this political climate many are more afraid of Donald Trump than coronavirus,\u201d Gonsalves tweeted. \u201cWe have to make them more afraid of us.\u201d\n\nSo, stay in, call your Congressperson, and order Chinese food.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Jason Silverstein on Twitter.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["culture", "news",
