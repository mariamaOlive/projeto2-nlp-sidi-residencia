The Free Press is a healthy institution financially and journalistically, and one quickly and successfully evolving with the times.\n\n2019 Community Impact report: 15 Free Press stories that spurred real-world change\n\nI\u2019ve had the great privilege to lead the Free Press newsroom for more than two years. I\u2019ve admired the deep commitment metro Detroiters have for this community and making change for the better. And I continue to be impressed by the dedication, intelligence and commitment to truth-telling my colleagues bring to you every day. This Community Impact Report is a testament to that commitment.\n\nOur guiding principle in the Free Press newsroom is to do important, revelatory and unique journalism and to continue to grow our digital audience. This section lays out some of the remarkable work done this year by our journalists \u2014 work that has helped to make a real difference in this community. Our digital audience will once again bring in a billion (yes, billion) page views.\n\nIn 2020, expect more of the deep-dive investigative reporting and engaging storytelling that is our hallmark. Expect detailed reporting of the presidential campaign in Michigan. Expect more nuanced coverage of Detroit. And dive in as we provide more news in more places using video, audio and podcasts.\n\nMost of all, thank you for reading the Free Press and at freep.com, and best wishes for 2020.\n\nPeter Bhatia\n\nEditor and Vice President", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This Community Impact Report lays out a cross section of the remarkable work done this year by our journalists \u2014 work that has helped to make a real difference in this community.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "A letter from Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia", "description": "This Community Impact Report lays out a cross section of the remarkable work done this year by our journalists \u2014 work that has helped to make a real difference in this community.", "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/29/peter-bhatia-letter/2702228001/", "site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/09/20/PDTF/2bb9f92b-1295-47f5-b74f-606201a8d45a-UAWstrike_091919_kpm_828.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y122&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2399, "height": 1350}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Peter Bhatia", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "This Community Impact Report lays out a cross section of the remarkable work done this year by our journalists \u2014 work that has helped to make a real difference in this community.", "fb": {"pages": 13642915529, "app_id": 185931034751252}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/09/20/PDTF/2bb9f92b-1295-47f5-b74f-606201a8d45a-UAWstrike_091919_kpm_828.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y122&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@freep", "creator": "@freep", "title": "A letter from Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia", "description": "This Community Impact Report lays out a cross section of the remarkable work done this year by our journalists \u2014 work that has helped to make a real difference in this community."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/29/peter-bhatia-letter/2702228001/"}
