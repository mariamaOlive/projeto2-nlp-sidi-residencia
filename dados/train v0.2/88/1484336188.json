The amount has not been set.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon on Dec. 19 and is backed by Gov. Janet Mills.\n\n\"The skyrocketing costs of insulin are simply unaffordable for too many Maine families, and no one should be forced to choose between life-saving medications and essentials like groceries or clothes for their kids,\" Gideon said in a recent release.\n\nAbout 10% of the state's population has the common chronic disease, and annual costs for insulin increased from $2,864 to $5,705 per patient from 2012 to 2016, according to a recent study by the Washington-based Health Care Cost Institute.\n\nSimilar bills will be considered next year in other states, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois and Wisconsin.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine bill would cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for more than 140,000 diabetes patients if it becomes law in 2020. \n If the proposed legislation goes through, Maine wou\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Maine bill would cap out-of-pocket cost of insulin for patients", "description": "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine bill would cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for more than 140,000 diabetes patients if it becomes law in 2020. \n If the proposed legislation goes through, Maine wou\u2026", "url": "https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2019/12/31/maine-bill-would-cap-out-of-pocket-cost-of-insulin-for-patients/1982481007/", "site_name": "Seacoastonline.com", "image": "https://www.seacoastonline.com/tangstatic/sites/npoh/og-image-q1a2z3f0a631d4.png", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Staff Writer", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine bill would cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for more than 140,000 diabetes patients if it becomes law in 2020. \n If the proposed legislation goes through, Maine wou\u2026", "fb": {"pages": 10153249920871122, "app_id": 1689412007891012}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@seacoastonline", "creator": "@seacoastonline", "title": "Maine bill would cap out-of-pocket cost of insulin for patients", "description": "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 A Maine bill would cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for more than 140,000 diabetes patients if it becomes law in 2020. \n If the proposed legislation goes through, Maine wou\u2026"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2019/12/31/maine-bill-would-cap-out-of-pocket-cost-of-insulin-for-patients/1982481007/"}
