Followed categories will be added to My News.\n\nPacific holiday spot Palau has taken a radical step towards protecting its marine life by banning sunscreen chemicals linked to coral bleaching.\n\nFrom January 1, sunscreen that includes ingredients like oxybenzone and octinoxate is no longer allowed to be worn or sold.\n\nThe compounds are commonly used in sunscreen formulas as they absorb ultraviolet A rays.\n\nThe pristine islands, which have a combined population of about 20000, are a famed diving location, and their lagoon is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nPalau is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately halfway between Australia and Japan.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the only nation leading the way, with Hawaii revealing in 2018 it was also legislating a ban against sunscreen that contained the toxic chemicals. The law comes into effect from January 1, 2021.\n\nIt is hoped by banning sunscreens that contain these chemicals, Hawaii can save its damaged coral reefs and set a new \u201cgold standard\u201d for the world to follow.\n\nThe tiny Pacific island nation of Palau is the first country to ban sunscreen that contains toxic reef chemicals. Picture: iStock\n\nPalau\u2019s President Tommy Remengesau said: \u201cWe have to live and respect the environment because the environment is the nest of life,\u201d the BBC reports.\n\nThe nation\u2019s leader said the decision was based on scientific reports that showed the toxic chemicals had been found throughout the reefs and in the tissues of fish who lived there.\n\n\u201cWhen science tells us that a practice is damaging to coral reefs, to fish populations or to the ocean itself, our people take note and our visitors do too,\u201d Mr Remengesau said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind being the first nation to ban these chemicals, and we will do our part to spread the word.\u201d\n\nBanned sunscreens will be confiscated from tourists who carry them into the country, and merchants selling the banned products will be fined up to $1395.\n\nRELATED: Sun protection survey says we\u2019re using sunscreen wrong\n\nRELATED: Sunscreen a coral kill on Far North Queensland\u2019s Great Barrier Reef\n\nWhile sunscreen isn\u2019t banned per se, products containing a list of banned ingredients are.
