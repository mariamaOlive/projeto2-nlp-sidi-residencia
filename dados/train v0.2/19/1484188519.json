Penh Police chief Lieutenant General Sar Thet has called on his police officers to do their utmost to crack down on crimes across the capital despite dips in figures.\n\nSpeaking at a promotion ceremony in Phnom Penh on Monday, Lt Gen Thet said that criminal cases declined in 2019 thanks to concerted efforts in cracking down on crimes.\n\n\u201cAccording to the 2019 report, felony offences have declined to 31 cases, and misdemeanour cases have declined to 177 cases,\u201d Lt Gen Thet said.\n\nHe said that police officers must ensure law enforcement, security and public order for the people.\n\n\u201cOur police officers must work harder to crack down on crimes so that they are declining,\u201d Lt Gen Thet said. \u201cSo we have to continue our efforts to control the situation so that it is calm with a good atmosphere.\u201d\n\nColonel Eng Sorphea, chief of Phnom Penh Municipal Police\u2019s Penal bureau, yesterday said that criminal offences declined in 2019 thanks to efforts by all police forces, especially district and commune law enforcement agents.\n\nCol Sorphea said that tally of crimes across Phnom Penh has yet been finalised.\n\n\u201cSo we can conclude that security and public order in 2019 is better than that in 2018,\u201d Col Sorphea said.\n\nYong Kim Eng, president of People Centre for Development and Peace, yesterday said he was still concerned about drug use.\n\n\u201cAlthough police report shows that criminal cases have declined, people are still concerned about their security, especially an increase of drug issues which affects security,\u201d Mr Kim Eng said.\n\nSan Chey, executive director of the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability, echoed Mr Kim Eng\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cEven though criminal offences have declined, people still worry about drug issues, especially gambling,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Sar Thet", "crimes", "Phnom Penh police", "National"], "authors":
