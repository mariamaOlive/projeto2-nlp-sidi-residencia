Picture by Niall Carson/PA\n\nFIVE Catholic priests in Northern Ireland have been recognised in the latest New Year's honours list announced by the British government.\n\nFr Eugene O'Hagan, his younger brother Fr Martin O'Hagan and Fr David Delargy \u2013 who achieved global success as singing group The Priests \u2013 accepted MBEs for their music and charity work.\n\nFr Stephen McBrearty, parish priest of Holywood in Co Down, was also made an MBE in recognition of his chaplaincy work inside prisons.\n\nAnd Drumquin parish priest Fr Kevin Mullan, who comforted bereaved families after the 1998 Omagh bomb, received a BEM (British Empire Medal) for services to inter-church collaboration and community relations.\n\nAlthough Irish Catholic priests such as Fr Brian D'Arcy have previously accepted royal honours, it is unusual to have five in one list \u2013 including four from the same diocese.\n\nSinging trio The Priests hit the big time in 2008 when their classical religious melodies became known internationally.\n\nThe clerics nurtured their musical talents from their early days together as students at St MacNissi's College, Garron Tower, Co Antrim.\n\nFr Eugene O'Hagan, originally from Glendermott in Derry, is Vicar General of the Down and Connor diocese, while Fr Martin O'Hagan is parish priest of Newtownards and Comber.\n\nFr Delargy, originally from the Ballymena area, is parish priest of the Loughshore Parishes of Whitehouse, Greencastle and St James.\n\nFr Eugene said the honour recognised music's role in building connections across the community.\n\n\"Music is a great bridge. It has been an enriching experience on both sides,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a recognition of that cross-community aspect to the world of music and something people have been able to tap into, so we are happy to accept the nomination.\"\n\nThe priests contribute to a charity called Sightsavers which works internationally to prevent blindness.\n\nFr McBrearty, originally from west Belfast, became a prison chaplain at Hydebank Wood in 1997 and was appointed lead Catholic chaplain in the north's prisons in 2008.\n\n\"This award recognises and pays tribute to the extraordinary contribution of all chaplains from all Christian denominations and other faiths \u2013 the men and women who untiringly give their service to the prison parish family,\" he said.\n\n\"Throughout the history of Northern Ireland Prison Service, chaplains have been appointed to spiritually and pastorally accompany those placed into their care and those they work alongside.\n\n\"In their ministry, chaplains bring an awareness of the need for prisoners to be reconciled and resettled into the community within which much pain and suffering has been caused by their actions.\"\n\nDown and Connor bishop Noel Treanor congratulated the diocesan priests.\n\n\"These awards, both individually and collectively, pay tribute to the well-deserved contribution of these priests to their respective fields of ministry, pastoral care and the wider community and also to the outreach and role of the Church within society,\" he said.\n\nFr Mullan's community work has included the Omagh Community Youth Choir, which was formed in the wake of the Omagh bomb, and cross-community youth initiative the Ulster Project.\n\nThe 73-year-old, who also forged high-profile links with Presbyterian minister Rev David Armstrong in Limavady in the 1980s, said he was \"really delighted\" to accept the honour.\n\n\"It underlines for me the importance of inter-church work. They recognise that for the good of society and stability that inter-church work is important,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a church forum in the area, and I think it's a lovely honour for them as well.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["The Priests", "New Year Honours", "Fr Kevin Mullan", ""], "tags": ["The Priests", "Fr Kevin Mullan", "New Year Honours"], "authors": ["Brendan Hughes"], "publish_date": "Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "FIVE Catholic priests in Northern Ireland have been recognised in the latest New Year's honours list announced by the British government.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//www.irishnews.com/static/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@irish_news", "title": "Five priests from Northern Ireland receive New Year's honours", "description": "FIVE Catholic priests in Northern Ireland have been recognised in the latest New Year's honours list announced by the British government.", "creator": "@irish_news", "domain": "www.irishnews.com", "image": "http://www.irishnews.com/picturesarchive/irishnews/irishnews/2019/12/27/194427064-43b16388-fc9f-45c8-b88e-cdadeb0368be.jpg"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/12/28/news/five-priests-from-northern-ireland-receive-new-year-s-honours-1800631/", "title": "Five priests from Northern Ireland receive New Year's honours", "description": "FIVE Catholic priests in Northern Ireland have been recognised in the latest New Year's honours list announced by the British government.", "site_name": "The Irish News", "image": "http://www.irishnews.com/picturesarchive/irishnews/irishnews/2019/12/27/194427064-43b16388-fc9f-45c8-b88e-cdadeb0368be.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-12-28T01:00:00Z"}, "author": "Brendan Hughes", "description": "FIVE Catholic priests in Northern Ireland have been recognised in the latest New Year's honours list announced by the British government.", "ff": {"page-type": "article", "theme-category": "news/northernirelandnews"}, "kt": {"page-type": "article", "section-path": "/news/northernirelandnews", "id": 1800631, "title": "Five priests from Northern Ireland receive New Year's honours"}, "keywords": "The Priests,New Year Honours,Fr Kevin Mullan,"}, "canonical_link": "http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/12/28/news/five-priests-from-northern-ireland-receive-new-year-s-honours-1800631/"}
