It's been fun to watch the event grow over the past two years. It's become a must-do to ring in the New Year.\"\n\nOrganizers estimate about 7,000 people attended, a big jump from last year's estimation of 3,200 people.\n\nMore:Detroit's big restaurant stories in 2019 \u2014 and what to look forward to in 2020\n\nMore:Detroit's cool things to do New Year's Eve\n\nContact Bisma Parvez: 313-222-6420 or bparvez@gannett.com Follow her on Twitter @bismapar", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thousands gathered at Detroit's Beacon Park to ring in the new decade", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Families ring in the new decade at early NYE party in Detroit's Beacon Park", "description": "Thousands gathered at Detroit's Beacon Park to ring in the new decade", "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2019/12/31/detroits-beacon-park-hosts-new-years-eve-kids-countdown/2784557001/", "site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/31/PDTF/700e1aaf-4e05-477d-8bb7-f6bd70213e75-123119_Balloondrop_AMB-7A.JPG?crop=1199,675,x0,y107&width=1199&height=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1199, "height": 675}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bisma Parvez", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Thousands gathered at Detroit's Beacon Park to ring in the new decade", "fb": {"pages": 13642915529, "app_id": 185931034751252}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/31/PDTF/700e1aaf-4e05-477d-8bb7-f6bd70213e75-123119_Balloondrop_AMB-7A.JPG?crop=1199,675,x0,y107&width=1199&height=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@freep", "creator": "@freep", "title": "Families ring in the new decade at early NYE party in Detroit's Beacon Park", "description": "Thousands gathered at Detroit's Beacon Park to ring in the new decade"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2019/12/31/detroits-beacon-park-hosts-new-years-eve-kids-countdown/2784557001/"}
