On Sunday, Israel's security cabinet approved a bill proposed by Defence Minister Naftali Bennett that would deduct $45 million from the annual sum of $550 million Israel transfers to the PA as part of the 1994 Paris Agreement.\n\nIsrael says that the tax money it collects for the Palestinians - and which is supposed to be used to pay officials' salaries as well as provide Palestinians with social welfare - goes to fund terrorists jailed in Israel for security offences, including the murder of Israelis. Palestinians don't deny these allegations but stress the money is essential to support families that have lost a bread-winner.\n\n\"We need to be sensitive to their needs and appreciate their cooperation. Unlike Yasser Arafat [late chairman of the PLO], who supported terror while talking peace to Israel, President Abbas rejects terrorism and we have to appreciate it\", Gilad noted, adding that he preferred to encourage the Palestinians, rather than punishing them for their contribution to Israel's security, which has brought about economic prosperity.\n\nMissed Opportunities\n\nIsrael has already lost an important ally that helped the Jewish state to combat terrorism - Turkey.\n\nIn 2010, news website UPI reported that Ankara had severed ties with Israel'd Mossad and stopped exchanging intelligence information and conducting joint operations with the country's spy agency.\n\nRelations between the two soured following Israel's 2008 Cast Lead Operation that saw more than a thousand Palestinians killed and as a result of Israeli forces' assault on six Turkish vessels bound for Gaza that resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish nationals.\n\n\"Terror suspects, arrested by our security forces, admitted that they had Turkish handlers\", said Gilad adding that it was unlikely for the Turkish government, which boasts superb intelligence capabilities, not to know about their existence.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["opinion", "israel", "palestinian authority", "turkey"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Blade"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 07:59:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The year 2019 was successful for Israel's security agencies, who although didn't manage to prevent the deaths of five Israelis murdered by Palestinian... 01.01.2020, Sputnik International", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/i/favicon/favicon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"description": "The year 2019 was successful for Israel's security agencies, who although didn't manage to prevent the deaths of five Israelis murdered by Palestinian... 01.01.2020, Sputnik International", "keywords": "opinion, israel, palestinian authority, turkey", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "referrer": "always", "format-detection": "address=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/i/favicon/favicon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#F4F4F4", "fb": {"app_id": 799135720145118, "pages": 357990416180}, "analytics": {"title": "Israel Succeeded in Averting Terror Attacks But Militants' Motivation Still on Rise", "keyw": "analysis, geo_Israel, geo_Palestinian_Authority, keyword_Terrorism, geo_Turkey, keyword_Palestinians", "tags": "Opinion, Israel, Palestinian Authority, Terrorism, Turkey, Palestinians", "site_domain": "sputniknews.com", "article_id": 1077913459, "url": "https://sputniknews.com/20200101/israel-succeeded-in-averting-terror-attacks-but-militants-motivation-still-on-rise-1077913459.html", "p_ts": 1577865566, "author": "Elizabeth Blade", "isscroll": 0}, "og": {"url": "https://sputniknews.com/20200101/israel-succeeded-in-averting-terror-attacks-but-militants-motivation-still-on-rise-1077913459.html", "title": "Israel Succeeded in Averting Terror Attacks But Militants' Motivation Still on Rise", "description": "The year 2019 was successful for Israel's security agencies, who although didn't manage to prevent the deaths of five Israelis murdered by Palestinian terrorists, did manage to avert multiple terror attacks.", "type": "article", "site_name": "Sputnik International", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1077913459.png?1577865567"}, "relap-image": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/i/logo/logo-social.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdnn1.img.sputniknews.com/sharing_snippet/1077913459.png?1577865567"}, "article": {"published_time": "20200101T0759+0000", "author": "Elizabeth Blade", "section": "News", "tag": "Turkey"}, "relap-entity-id": 1077913459}, "canonical_link": "https://sputniknews.com/20200101/israel-succeeded-in-averting-terror-attacks-but-militants-motivation-still-on-rise-1077913459.html"}
