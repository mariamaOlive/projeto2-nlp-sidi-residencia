Everybody's scared of his power, so everybody's moving all the time.\n\n\"Fury realized in the 12th round after Deontay knocked him down, almost knocked him out, he got up and started chasing Deontay, and Deontay fought sloppy. He said he looked awkward.\"\n\nFury did take the centre of the ring straight away in the first round and it was a position that he barely gave up as for most he won every single round of the fight.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nHe and his team claimed that Wilder was a bully and when bullies are forced back they don't know how to handle it, and so it proved.\n\nThe Brit twice knocked down his American opponent, in the third and fifth round, before eventually having the fight stopped when the Bronze Bomber's corner through in the towel.\n\nWilder has 30 days to activate a rematch clause for the trilogy fight and has said that he plans on making sure there is a third fight, after they fought out a draw in the original fight.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nMany fight fans would prefer if the former WBC champion moved aside to allow the current champ to fight fellow Englishman Anthony Joshua in a unification fight but that looks unlikely right now.\n\nFury landed a lot on the front foot.
