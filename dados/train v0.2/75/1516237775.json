Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) used an end-of-year address to take aim at the GOP lawmakers who continue to defend President Donald Trump at all costs, describing them as \u201cfawning\u201d and \u201cspineless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a few hours, the dawn of a new year will break over America, offering us a moment for pause and reflection,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told supporters at an event in Boston on Tuesday. \u201cNow, it is normally a moment for optimism. But let\u2019s face it, this year in America has been anything but normal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the past 12 months, the president has become bolder with his lies and more brazen in his law-breaking,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cHe has tried to squeeze a foreign government to advance his own political fortunes. Meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress have turned into fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes.\u201d\n\nWarren said it had \u201cbrought no one any joy\u201d to impeach Trump over the Ukraine scandal, but said House Democrats had \u201cupheld their sworn duty to the Constitution\u201d in doing so. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has so far declined to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate amid fears of Republican bias in a trial of the president.\n\nWarren warned that \u201cunless some Senate Republicans choose truth over politics, Trump will be emboldened to try to cheat his way through yet another election.\u201d \u201cOur democracy hangs in the balance,\u201d she later added.\n\nCheck out Warren\u2019s full speech here:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald Trump", "Politics and Government", "Politics", "Elizabeth Warren", "Republican Party United States"], "tags": ["Social Justice", "Level Up Your Gifts", "HuffPost Press Room", "Donald Trump", "Politics", "Coronavirus", "Republican Party United States", "Republicans", "Elizabeth Warren", "Joe Biden", "Extremism", "The Legacy Lives On", "Nancy Pelosi", "Politics and Government", "Democrats", "Congress", "GOP lawmakers"], "authors": ["Reporter"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 08:38:54 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Democratic presidential candidate warned what would happen if some Senate Republicans don't \"choose truth over politics.\"", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate warned what would happen if some Senate Republicans don't \"choose truth over politics.\"", "keywords": "Donald Trump,Politics and Government,Politics,Elizabeth Warren,Republican Party United States", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Elizabeth Warren Rips \u2018Fawning, Spineless\u2019 Republicans In End-Of-Year Speech", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c596c2400009f245a4ad2.jpeg?cache=AImjusWseo&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c596c2400009f245a4ad2.jpeg?cache=AImjusWseo&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-republicans-trump-2020_n_5e0c5229e4b0843d360cec6d", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate warned what would happen if some Senate Republicans don't \"choose truth over politics.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Donald Trump,Politics and Government,Politics,Elizabeth Warren,Republican Party United States", "section": "Politics", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/leemoranjournalist/", "published_time": "2020-01-01T08:38:54Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:58:35Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "title": "Elizabeth Warren Rips \u2018Fawning, Spineless\u2019 Republicans In End-Of-Year Speech", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c596c2400009f245a4ad2.jpeg?cache=AImjusWseo&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate warned what would happen if some Senate Republicans don't \"choose truth over politics.\"", "creator": "@Lee_Moran"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5e0c5229e4b0843d360cec6d", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "sailthru.title": "Elizabeth Warren Rips \u2018Fawning, Spineless\u2019 Republicans In End-Of-Year Speech", "sailthru.tags": "Donald Trump,Politics and Government,Politics,Elizabeth Warren,Republican Party United States", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e0c596c2400009f245a4ad2.jpeg?cache=AImjusWseo&ops=1778_1000", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "taboola.category": "politics"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-republicans-trump-2020_n_5e0c5229e4b0843d360cec6d"}
