Followed categories will be added to My News.\n\nAs 2019 came to a close, celebrities around the world farewelled the decade in myriad ways. Whether celebrating with family and friends, reflecting on their own, enjoying romantic vacations, attending lavish parties or having a booze-free start to the new year, these celebs all had one thing in common \u2014 they shared it on Instagram, of course.\n\nHailey Bieber posted a pic of her and hubby Justin locked in a smooch and wrote, \u201cPlease be my New Year\u2019s kiss even when I\u2019m 80!!!\u201d\n\n61-year-old Madonna, who\u2019s had to postpone her US tour due to injury, shared pictures of herself on a beachy family vacation \u2014 along with her new beau, her 25-year-old backing dancer Ahlamalik Williams.\n\nWilliams has reportedly been seeing Madonna for about a year, but a photo of the couple only emerged for the first time a few weeks ago, when they were spotted canoodling on a hotel balcony in Miami.\n\nWilliams joined Madonna and her children, daughter Lourdes, 25, whom she shares with actor Carlos Leon; son David Banda, 14; daughter Mercy James, 14; and twin girls Estere and Stella Ciconne, 7.\n\n\u201cSaying Goodbye to 2019! We Continue to Swim with Sharks! And Take the Road Less Traveled\u201d, Madge wrote.\n\nLater she posted a video of her doing a sultry pole dance on the beach, cocktail in hand, as she rang in the new year.\n\nOther celebs such as Beyonce reflected on the year that was with a series of images, or in Beyonce\u2019s case, a \u201cBey-Cap\u201d 96-second video collage of the year\u2019s most memorable and glamorous moments.\n\nMeeting Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at The Lion King premiere in London made the cut.\n\nJennifer Lopez reflected back to 2010 and all the things that had happened since then, saying she feels stronger and more at peace now than ever, and encouraged followers to \u201cGet ready to roar!!!\u201d\n\nThe Sussex Royals, meanwhile, posted their own highlights reel, also featuring the meet and greet with Bey and Jay-Z, along with the birth of baby Archie, their trip to Africa, their charity work throughout the year, and much more.\n\n\u201cWishing you all a very Happy New Year and thanking you for your continued support!\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve loved meeting so many of you from around the world and can\u2019t wait to meet many more of you next year. We hope 2020 brings each of you health and continued happiness.\u201d - The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton posted their own collage which was twice as long, but the Sussexes had a better soundtrack (Clocks by Coldplay vs. what sounded like hold music for the Kensington Palace video). Both royal couples were featured in each others\u2019 videos, which some have interpreted as an olive branch.\n\nMiley Cyrus posted footage of herself wearing a \u201cCheers\u201d tiara and blowing out two sets of the number \u201c20\u201d candles on a cake. It\u2019s unclear whether or not she accompanied boyfriend Cody Simpson to The Surf Lodge in Aspen, Colorado, where he performed a NYE rock and roll set.\n\nSimpson also posted a photo of the couple to Instagram stories, saying, \u201cI love my girl so much I could write 20 books.\u201d\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner clan spent the start of 2020 apart, but no one missed the opp for a reflective post.\n\nKimmy posted a simple, \u201cTo lots of love in 2020\u201d post featuring her planting a kiss on hubby Kanye West.\n\nKylie posted a sultry lingerie series with the caption, \u201cJust didn\u2019t feel right going into 2020 without one last thirst trap.\u201d\n\nKendall posted a glamorous video collage from the year past while Khloe accompanied her own collage with some words of wisdom.\n\n\u201c2019, Im happily saying goodbye. They tell you that you shouldn\u2019t look back but I\u2019m going to suggest that you do. Be brave, look back and reflect on your past year; Or the past decade! It\u2019s OK to remind yourself of what you went through and what you overcame.\n\nWe may not be able to control what happens to us but we can control how we react to it. We must remember that all things are powerless unless we give them power. So let that power be empathy, understanding, kindness, grace, love and respect. ... I pray you leave everything that does not serve you purpose, happiness, peace, love and health back in 2019.\n\n2020 I welcome you with all of my heart!!\u201d\n\nBack in Oz, Bec Judd had a sparkly NYE with pals Nadia Bartel and Kylie Brown. \u201cKid\u2019s glitter set got the better of me last night (and so did the champagne).\n\n2020s let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nBartel, who has had a rough year following her split with Jimmy, posted another couple of glam party shots, including one from Melbourne\u2019s Stokehouse bar and restaurant on St Kilda Beach.\n\nAfter spending time in Oz over Christmas, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban headed back to the US, where Nic posted a sweet pic from Tennessee, where she and Urban are based.\n\n\u201cMy favourite way to ring in the new year - watching @keithurban play in Nashville.
