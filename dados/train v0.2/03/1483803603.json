(Photos) (2) (3) (4)\n\n(1) (2) (3) (4) (Reply) (Go Down)\n\n...calls for national prayer for Nigeria\n\n\n\nArogbonlo Israel\n\n\n\nGeneral Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Pastor Daniel Olukoya, has called for continuous prayer for Nigeria, adding that it was easy to identify a problem but hard to proffer a solution.\n\n\n\nOlukoya said this while revealing 33 prophetic declarations for the year at the Cross over service at MFM prayer city, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHe said 2020 categorised a year where there will be a lots of political shaking among the leaders of Nigeria, which he summed up as 'palm-up, palm-down'.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThis year (2020), rapid prayer is needed against national, economic, and political oblivion.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cA year when the Lord shall dash into pieces the kingdom of wicked rulers. It will be a year of ups and downs. It's what you can call a 'palm-up, palm-down'. A palm-up is for receiving while palm-down is for losing,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe cleric cautioned the youths to stay away from all forms of sexual perversion as God would be sanctioning all perpetrators of this unwholesome acts.\n\n\n\nOlukoya tagged 2020 as a year of spiritual revival and new glory. http://community.vanguardngr.com/forum/topics/breaking-mfm-s-pastor-olukoya-unveils-33-prophetic-declarations 20 Likes 7 Shares\n\nGlory to God 14 Likes 2 Shares\n\nWon tun ti de oo 75 Likes 2 Shares\n\nWhere is it? 3 Likes\n\nLol... on behalf of myself and every forward thinking Nigerians, please stick your prophesy up your arse!!\n\n\n\nThank you and God bless!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mumu no even see corona virus!
