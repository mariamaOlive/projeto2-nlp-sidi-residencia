Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday night that another 12 people have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the state\u2019s total to 45.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment in Michigan. We are up to the challenge and we\u2019ll do everything to mitigate the challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery decision we\u2019ve made has been based on the best science and the best facts.\u201d\n\nThe state has the capacity to test about 115 samples a day, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the chief medical executive at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. But private labs and hospitals also are beginning to come on board to begin testing what is expected to be a widely burgeoning number of samples.\n\nMore:Where are the coronavirus cases in Michigan?\n\nMore:Michigan reacts as coronavirus hits the state\n\nWithout the additional help from hospitals and labs, the state might not be able to get results for 72 hours.\n\nCasinos have been a continuing question as the virus has spread. Often filled with elderly people, sitting shoulder to shoulder at slot machines and gaming tables, it is an ideal place for transmission of the virus. Some of the casinos have been trying to section off areas with temporary walls to stay under the 250 person limit, but Whitmer said the Gaming Control Board was working to at least temporarily to shut down the casinos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working diligently to put a policy together and enforce it so that there is a temporary closure of casinos,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThere is a lot of close contact in the casinos, so we\u2019re taking a serious look at that.\u201d\n\nSocial distancing is key, Whitmer said, in flattening the curve of the coronavirus so that hospitals will have the capacity to treat patients over a longer period of time.\n\n\u201cWith social distancing, we can slow down the number of infections and give our hospitals more time to respond,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd to deal with essential items and food flying off grocery store shelves, Whitmer said the spring weight restrictions that are usually put on trucks at this time of year has been lifted so that trucks can make more frequent deliveries to stores so that they can restock their shelves.\n\nThe number of cases in the state have ticked up since Tuesday when the state announced its first two cases of the virus that causes the global, deadly COVID-19 respiratory illness. Whitmer also announced a state of emergency on Tuesday.\n\nSince then, the state has moved to close all K-12 schools, public and private universities have closed, and gatherings of more than 250 people have been banned.\n\nContact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "As the number of coronavirus cases grows to 45 in Michigan, the state is working to temporarily close Detroit's casinos.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Coronavirus cases grow to 45 in Michigan, state working to temporarily close casinos", "description": "As the number of coronavirus cases grows to 45 in Michigan, the state is working to temporarily close Detroit's casinos.", "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/15/whitmer-tracking-michigan-coronavirus-cases-rise-45-covid-19-detroit-casinos/5055904002/", "site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/15/PDTF/db6bfc14-f2fd-4e0c-9869-f2139e4b3d31-whitmer.jpg?crop=1999,1125,x0,y104&width=1999&height=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1999, "height": 1125}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Kathleen Gray", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "As the number of coronavirus cases grows to 45 in Michigan, the state is working to temporarily close Detroit's casinos.", "fb": {"pages": 13642915529, "app_id": 185931034751252}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/15/PDTF/db6bfc14-f2fd-4e0c-9869-f2139e4b3d31-whitmer.jpg?crop=1999,1125,x0,y104&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@freep", "creator": "@freep", "title": "Coronavirus cases grow to 45 in Michigan, state working to temporarily close casinos", "description": "As the number of coronavirus cases grows to 45 in Michigan, the state is working to temporarily close Detroit's casinos."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/15/whitmer-tracking-michigan-coronavirus-cases-rise-45-covid-19-detroit-casinos/5055904002/"}
