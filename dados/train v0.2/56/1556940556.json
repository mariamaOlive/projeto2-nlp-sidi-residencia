Please consider supporting local journalism by subscribing at News-Leader.com/subscribe.\n\nThe Springfield Police Department announced some changes in the way it will deal with calls for help and contact with the public because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn a news release, the department says officers remain on patrol and will continue to respond to calls for service.\n\nHowever, in compliance with personal distance guidelines, people who are able will be asked to meet officers outside of their residence or business and maintain a minimum distance of six feet from the officer during the interaction.\n\nIf you call police, dispatchers might ask additional questions to determine the appropriate level of police response.\n\nEach incident will be evaluated by the telecommunicators, police supervisors, and responding officers to determine the type of police response you may receive. You may be directed to call information into the police department, an officer may contact you by telephone or you may be instructed to complete an online report.\n\nThese efforts are designed to limit contact as much as possible while still providing police service and maintaining a healthy community and department while following updated health guidelines.\n\nQuestions about the changes can be directed to SPD's non-emergency phone line, 417-864-1810.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "These efforts are designed to limit contact as much as possible while still providing police service...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Springfield Police Department modifies how it will interact with public", "description": "These efforts are designed to limit contact as much as possible while still providing police service...", "url": "https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2020/03/23/springfield-police-department-modifies-contact-procedures/2903587001/", "site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/01/PSPR/32e8e101-46cc-4d1a-9e30-ab9ba2462f77-generic_police_situation.jpg?crop=1636,927,x0,y0&width=1636&height=927&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1636, "height": 927}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Wes Johnson", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "These efforts are designed to limit contact as much as possible while still providing police service...", "fb": {"pages": 63475094632, "app_id": 164654783578465}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/10/01/PSPR/32e8e101-46cc-4d1a-9e30-ab9ba2462f77-generic_police_situation.jpg?crop=1636,927,x0,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@springfieldNL", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "title": "Springfield Police Department modifies how it will interact with public", "description": "These efforts are designed to limit contact as much as possible while still providing police service..."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2020/03/23/springfield-police-department-modifies-contact-procedures/2903587001/"}
