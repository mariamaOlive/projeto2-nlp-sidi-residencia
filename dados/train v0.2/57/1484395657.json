They act just like normal cats, but you just have to make a couple of accommodations for them.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nDetroit doughnut shop closes its doors \u2014 but says $15,000 could prompt reopening\n\nPolice: Robert Carmack's blood alcohol content was 3 times legal limit during Oct. arrest\n\nOne accommodation: They don't do well on the stairs. Another, they need to be in a home with furniture that won't get rearranged, and, in which the owner is willing to consider setting up some textured pathways that will let the cats know where they are going because, of course, they can't see.\n\nSince they were young, the two kittens had trouble with their sight, which was causing them pain, Chrisman said. So, to help them, she added, the humane society had no choice but to completely remove their eyes.\n\nAnnie and Winnie, who are now bonded and must be adopted together, seem to have opposite personalities.\n\nAnnie, who is gray and weighs just over 3 pounds, is an \"action-packed cat,\" who is \"ready to play, play, play,\" according to her humane society description. She can \"get carried away sometimes and play too rough,\" and needs help following \"the house rules of what is acceptable.\"\n\nHowever, Winnie, a brown tabby, is just over 4 pounds and very shy. She is \"unsure of new situations,\" tends to not want to rush into any situation, is startled by noises, and when nervous, may spin in circles until calmed with gentle petting.\n\nZack, also a shorthair, is 12 years old and weighs more than 30 pounds. He is on a special diet and needs an owner, Chrisman said, who will help him get healthy and slim down by eating right and getting enough daily exercise.\n\nZack may be chunky, Chrisman said, but he's also a pretty cool cat.\n\nMore information on the cats is available at www.michiganhumane.org/cats-and-kittens or 866-MHU-MANE.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Adopting pets with special needs will require more compassion and patience, but, animal experts say, they also can provide special joy.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Eyeless kittens, 30-pound cat up for adoption in Michigan", "description": "Adopting pets with special needs will require more compassion and patience, but, animal experts say, they also can provide special joy.", "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/31/michigan-humane-society-eyeless-kittens-adoption/2783807001/", "site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/31/PDTF/efc334a7-3c24-4623-9ce2-1d83490fa05c-winnieannie2.jpg?crop=1027,578,x0,y128&width=1027&height=578&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1027, "height": 578}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Frank Witsil", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Adopting pets with special needs will require more compassion and patience, but, animal experts say, they also can provide special joy.", "fb": {"pages": 13642915529, "app_id": 185931034751252}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/31/PDTF/efc334a7-3c24-4623-9ce2-1d83490fa05c-winnieannie2.jpg?crop=1027,578,x0,y128&width=1027&height=513&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@freep", "creator": "@freep", "title": "Eyeless kittens, 30-pound cat up for adoption in Michigan", "description": "Adopting pets with special needs will require more compassion and patience, but, animal experts say, they also can provide special joy."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/31/michigan-humane-society-eyeless-kittens-adoption/2783807001/"}
