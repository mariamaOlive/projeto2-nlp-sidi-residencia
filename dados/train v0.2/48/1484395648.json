John Albert Shelemba, 19, of Hamtramck were identified in September; he was reported missing in action on July 20, 1950, while defending Taejon, South Korea, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) said Monday.\n\nShelemba was a member of Company L, 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division.\n\nAfter the war, the American Graves Registration Services worked to recover the remains of U.S. soldiers killed on South Korean battlefields. Shelemba's body was recovered but couldn't be identified, and he was subsequently buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.\n\nMore news on freep.com:\n\nYouTube artist Jeffree Star donates $20,000 for Michigan man's funeral\n\nMount Clemens soldier killed in World War II returns to Michigan after more than 75 years\n\nThe DPAA disinterred his remains in October 2018.
