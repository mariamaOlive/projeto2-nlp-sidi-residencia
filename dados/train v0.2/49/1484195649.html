				<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="featured__span-first-words">Hello and welcome</span> back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s finally 2020, the year that should bring us a direct listing from home-sharing giant <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb">Airbnb</a>, a technology company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/airbnb-closes-1b-round-at-31b-valuation-profitable-as-of-2h-2016-no-plans-for-ipo/">valued at tens of billions of dollars</a>. The company&#8217;s flotation will be a key event in this coming year&#8217;s technology exit market. Expect the NYSE and Nasdaq to compete for the listing, bankers to queue to take part, and endless media coverage.</p>
<p>Given that that&#8217;s ahead, we&#8217;re going to take periodic looks at Airbnb as we tick closer to its eventual public market debut. And that means that this morning we&#8217;re looking back through time to see how fast the company has grown by using a quirky data point.</p>
<p>Airbnb releases a regular tally of its expected &#8220;guest stays&#8221; for New Year&#8217;s Eve each year, including 2019. We can therefore look back in time, tracking how quickly (or not) Airbnb&#8217;s New Year Eve guest tally has risen. This exercise will provide a loose, but fun proxy for the company&#8217;s growth as a whole.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p>Before we look into the figures themselves, keep in mind that we are looking at a guest figure which is at <em>best</em> a proxy for revenue. We don&#8217;t know the revenue mix of the guest stays, for example, meaning that Airbnb could have seen a 10% drop in per-guest revenue this New Year&#8217;s Eve — even with more guest stays — and we&#8217;d have no idea.</p>
<p>So, the cliche about grains of salt and taking, please.</p>
<p>But as more guests tends to mean more rentals which points towards more revenue, the New Year&#8217;s Eve figures are useful as we work to understand how quickly Airbnb is growing <em>now</em> compared to how fast it grew in the past. The faster the company is expanding today, the more it&#8217;s worth. And given recent news that the company has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airbnb-lost-100-million-in-q2">ditched profitability</a> in favor of <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/airbnbs-q1-loss-more-than-doubled-new-data-shows">boosting its sales and marketing</a> spend (leading to sharp, regular deficits in its quarterly results), how fast Airbnb can grow through higher spend is a key question for the highly-backed, San Francisco-based private company.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the tally of guest stays in Airbnb&#8217;s during New Years Eve (data <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/02/airbnb-from-1400-guests-on-new-years-eve-2009-to-over-3-million.html">via CNBC</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/1079772695087251456">Jon Erlichman</a>,<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/how-airbnb-is-working-to-protect-you-this-holiday-season/"> Airbnb</a>), and their resulting year-over-year growth rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>2009: 1,400</li>
<li>2010: 6,000 (+329%)</li>
<li>2011: 3,1000 (+417%)</li>
<li>2012: 108,000 (248%)</li>
<li>2013: 250,000 (+131%)</li>
<li>2014: 540,000 (+116%)</li>
<li>2015: 1,100,000 (+104%)</li>
<li>2016: 2,000,000 (+82%)</li>
<li>2017: 3,000,000 (+50%)</li>
<li>2018: 3,700,000 (+23%)</li>
<li>2019: 4,500,000 (+22%)</li>
</ul>
<p>In chart form, that looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1928282" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?w=597" alt="" width="597" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=132,150 132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=264,300 264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=768,874 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=597,680 597w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=1349,1536 1349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=1799,2048 1799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about a few things that stand out. First is that the company&#8217;s growth rate managed to stay over 100% for as long as it did. In case you&#8217;re a SaaS fan, what Airbnb pulled off in its early years (again, using this fun proxy for revenue growth) was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/">far better than a triple-triple-double-double-double</a>.</p>
<p>Next, the company&#8217;s growth rate in percentage terms has slowed dramatically, including in 2019. At the same time the firm managed to <em>re-accelerate</em> its gross guest growth in 2019. In numerical terms, Airbnb added 1,000,000 New Year&#8217;s Eve guest stays in 2017, 700,000 in 2018, and 800,000 in 2019. So 2019&#8217;s gross adds was not a record, but it was a better result than its year-ago tally.</p>

Both companies should debut in early 2022<\/p>\n<p>Why file now given the impending holiday period? Via has posted impressive results in recent quarters, so getting its ducks in a row \u2013 shuttles in a line? \u2013 for an early-early IPO is far from aggressive. It\u2019s reasonable, frankly, given that tech valuations are still strong despite recent declines. And companies that can go public may want to take advantage of the IPO window while it\u2019s open.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2250384\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/via-transportation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Per Crunchbase,<\/a> Via has raised $777.1 million in known funding to date, from investors including Macquarie Capital, Mori Building, Shell, 83North, Broadscale Group, Ervington Investments, Hearst Ventures, Planven Ventures, Pitango and RiverPark Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>Last month Via announced a $130 million round that pushed the on-demand shuttle and software company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/30\/via-raises-130m-to-expand-on-demand-shuttle-software-business\/\">to a $3.3 billion valuation<\/a>. We suppose that that was a pre-IPO round, in retrospect. The capital event came on the heels of TransitTech, Via\u2019s software platform, doubling year over year to exceed an annual run rate of $100 million.<\/p>\n<p>More simply, Via has reached the threshold of IPO scale in revenue terms, not taking into account other possible income streams at the company. So its IPO timing once again makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>Past the software revenue result, after originally taking five years to land its first city partnership, the company today has over 500 partners, including Los Angeles Metro, Jersey City and Miami.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Life has not proved pothole free for Via. The company saw mixed demand for its business amidst the pandemic. While ridership <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/31\/on-demand-shuttle-startup-via-hits-2-25-billion-valuation-on-latest-funding-round-led-by-exor\/\">initially dropped due to the disease<\/a>, cities focused more on emergency services &#8212; helping generate demand for Via\u2019s software platform. From a business perspective, that\u2019s good news considering the stickiness of a city contract.<\/p>\n<p>Via has beefed up its operations over the past few years, perhaps hinting at plans to make a pitch for a public debut. In March, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/09\/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million\/\">the company bought Remix<\/a>, which created software for cities to use for transportation planning and street design, for $100 million. It also acquired<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fleetonomy.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Fleetonomy.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Via won\u2019t be the only mobility startup racing toward a 2022 public debut. This month, Voi Scooters <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/20\/2250109\/\">raised a $115 million Series D in preparation for an IPO<\/a> and Kakao Mobility picked up a $4.2 billion valuation <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/01\/kakao-mobility-picks-up-additional-55m-funding-at-over-4-2b-valuation\/\">ahead of its rumored listing. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch has a series of questions for the filing, once we get our hands on it. For example, we\u2019re curious whether the company is able to generate traditional SaaS gross margins while selling to governments. And how long are its sales cycles? Even more, how deeply penetrated is its core market? And where did all that capital raised get spent?

continues.<\/p>\n<p>On the EU side, the Commission&#8217;s investigation looked at horizontal overlaps between Nuance and Microsoft in the markets for transcription software &#8212; finding the two provide very different products (out-of-the-box software for end-users versus APIs targeted at devs wanting to add speech recognition tech to their apps, respectively).<\/p>\n<p>It also determined that the combined entity will continue to face &#8220;strong&#8221; competition from other players.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The EU looked at the vertical link between Microsoft&#8217;s cloud computing services and Nuance&#8217;s downstream transcription software for healthcare, too &#8212; but found competing transcription service providers in the sector do not depend on Microsoft for cloud computing.<\/p>\n<p>Nor are these type of transcription service providers particularly key users of cloud computing, per the Commission.<\/p>\n<p>Its investigation considered conglomerate links between Nuance&#8217;s software (which is only available for Windows) and a number of Microsoft products as well &#8212; but took the view that the combined entity would not have the ability and\/or incentive to foreclose competitors in the markets for (healthcare) transcription software; enterprise communication services; CRM software; productivity software; and PC operating systems.<\/p>\n<p>And, there again, the EU decided the combined entity will still face strong competition.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most interestingly, the Commission looked at the use of data transcribed by Nuance&#8217;s software.<\/p>\n<p>This is interesting because healthcare data is highly sensitive and Microsoft &#8212; while not a massive player in adtech &#8212; does have ambitions

implosion marked one of the most high-profile consumer electronics startup failures in recent memory. Launched in 2017 with $330 million, a killer pedigree and some truly grand ambitions, the company sputtered through a combination of industry issues, disappointment and troubling allegations against founder Andy Rubin.<\/p>\n<p>The brand was eventually purchased by Carl Pei for his new company. But the executive eventually bucked the name in favor of &#8220;Nothing.&#8221; \u201c[B]efore we were called Nothing, \u2018Essential\u2019 was one of the names we were brainstorming, internally,\u201d he told me earlier this year \u201cSo that\u2019s why we\u2019ve acquired the trademark. We don\u2019t have any plans to do anything with Essential.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Something far closer to a spiritual successor arrives in the form of OSOM. The company, founded by ex-Essential employees, has had a smattering of press coverage over the past several months, but has largely kept quiet. Today, however, the Cupertino, California-based firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/osom-ov1-exclusive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed what many long suspected:<\/a>\u00a0OSOM (pronounced \u201cawesome\u201d) is working on a phone.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2250521\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Its planned OV1 device is, at least aesthetically, very clearly the work of the same team that gave the world the Essential PH1. But rather than features like modularity, the product is designed with one core thing in mind: Privacy. Specifically, it\u2019s designed to give users greater control over data privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, details are scarce, ahead of its planned MWC 2022 launch. We sat down with co-founder and CEO Jason Keats for more information on OSOM and its upcoming handset.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: We\u2019re about two months out from the announcement?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>JK: Yeah, we\u2019re a couple of months out from sharing the fine details. We\u2019re planning the give the full announcement at MWC, and then shipping summer 2022. Right now we\u2019re ready to announce that we are building a phone. People are really excited. We wanted to give our fans something this year, and we\u2019re coming in under the wire.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>What constitutes a fan at this point, given that the company has been under lock and key?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been really surprising. Essential fans were very, very supportive early on, and they\u2019ve continued to be supportive and excited about what we\u2019re building for the future. I think we\u2019re going to pick up quite a few traditional Android fans. Right now there aren\u2019t a lot of flagship phones outside of Pixel that are vanilla Android. We\u2019re going to continue that, and we\u2019ve already built and are continuing to refine some privacy-centric software.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How many of the existing team have come over from Essential?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When we built PH1 at Essential, we were maybe 30 people total. We have maybe 15 people from that team. It\u2019s really the core group of people; design, engineer, product design and software engineering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How large is the team in total?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Around 30 people [\u2026] We\u2019re more than two-thirds engineering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you begin the process of building up one company from, effectively, the ashes of another?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For all of the shortcomings and incidences that happened at Essential, one thing that I will praise [Rubin] forever for is his ability to recruit. He brought on some incredible talent. When he told me that the company was going under, I said, what I am going to do next? I don\u2019t want to work for Google or Apple or go to Amazon, but there\u2019s this incredible team there that has built stuff and worked together so closely. It\u2019s been through the trenches together[\u2026]<\/p>\n<p>We realized that probably the biggest issue [with Essential] was a lack of focus. We realized we needed to have a purpose. What are we trying to solve for? It became obvious to us that privacy really wasn\u2019t being addressed coherently, particularly in 2020.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does the world need another phone company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely I think they do. One that\u2019s actually focused on protecting privacy. And there\u2019s a big reason for that. If we were just a software company building privacy software, we could trhow it on the Play Store, people could install it, whatever. But if it\u2019s just an app sitting on someone\u2019s phone, it\u2019s easily bypassed, it\u2019s easily turned off, because it\u2019s not built into the system. It\u2019s not integrated into the device. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Because we\u2019re an OEM, because we have access to Qualcomm\u2019s TrustZone, because we have access to the system software, we can build some real privacy-centric software that the user can use or not use, if they chose. But it\u2019s all about giving them a choice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How difficult will it be to get someone to jump over to this phone with privacy as a main selling point?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the U.S., I\u2019m not trying to go after Apple users. We\u2019re going after Android users. And in that scenario, there isn\u2019t a tremendous amount of brand loyalty within the Android space. People are willing to take a lot more shots. For privacy, we\u2019ve already lined up quite a few partners that have shared some high-level demgraphic data about who is using their software or hardware for privacy. The numbers are astonishing to us. They really indicate that there is a demand for privacy and that people are currently spending their money today on privacy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s a realistic expectation in terms of units? You\u2019re casting a wide net [to the U.S., Canada and throughout Europe]. It seems ultimately the Essential numbers weren\u2019t what people were hoping for.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s funny. When we started Essential, the goal was 100,000 units in the first year. We sold just shy of 300,000 units to end users the first year. The biggest issue is because [Rubin] raised so much money, the expectation was to ship two million units. When you go into expecting 100,000 units and sell 300,000 units, that\u2019s a huge success. It all depends on what metric you\u2019re using. For [OSOM], I would be absolutely thrilled with 200,000 units in the first year. We would be here for a very, very long time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Were the external expectations so intense as to cause things to fall apart [at Essential]?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can fill up a book on what went wrong. And there were a bunch of little things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Give me the CliffsNotes.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some decisions made at the very top were counterintuitive to us being successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On the note of capital, it was reported that the company raised $5.6 million. What has the fundraising been so far.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, we secured $20 million. Some of it investor, and a chunk of it was pre-order from a channel partner. We\u2019ve already got orders that are close to the number that we can support in the first year. We did have the bulk of our investors come from myself and my co-founder Wolfgang and our external VCs were all primarily Canadian companies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has there been a Series A on top of the initial seed funding?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are currently in the middle of a Series A.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Was Playground involved?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. We had a nice long chat with them. The team over there &#8212; Bruce, Matt and Peter &#8212; are still very good friends. I still use them as sounding boards for ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When was the company officially launched?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The articles of incorporation were officially filed on 4 20 2020.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The name is pronounced \u201cawesome?\u201d Which was first, the name or the acronym?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Twenty minutes after [Rubin] told me that Essential was going under, I&#8217;m like, \u201cAlright, I&#8217;m gonna do my own thing.\u201d I hate stuff that\u2019s super overt. I hate all the wires and plugs and this and that all over your house, and it drives me nuts. And I had this idea for a different product, which we may or may not eventually build. It has nothing to do with the phone, but just some crazy idea. But the idea was out of sight, out of mind. I think what the people, what the average consumer really pictures when we talk about the future technology in Star Trek, and the sense of speaking and something answers out of the ether. It\u2019s not a thing sitting on my desk that has a cable that&#8217;s nine feet long, but it&#8217;s only eight inches from the wall. The idea was this thing that comes out of ether, and the idea was &#8220;out of sight out of mind. Oh, OSOM, we&#8217;ll just call it awesome.&#8221; I registered it from the hotel in Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Any of those initial ideas being applied here? Obviously, privacy is the thing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly the mentality, because of the way we&#8217;re building our software. The idea is that, again, it maintains an out of sight, out of mind; you should just trust that your devices are keeping you safe when you want to be safe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For the time being it&#8217;s an American company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. We\u2019re a Delaware C Corp. Like every other tech company, probably all registered at the exact same address.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve talked to the Canadian government about incentives&#8230; but you&#8217;re going to continue to be headquartered in Cupertino?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right now, that&#8217;s up in the air. OSOM Products, the U.S. company, will continue to exist. But we may move our headquarters up to Canada.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the common threads between Essential and OSOM? Philosophical? Aesthetic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aesthetically, 100%. Even though it&#8217;s the same designer, Dave Evans and myself doing the industrial design, we didn&#8217;t really think about it as an obvious successor to the PH1, until we had the first prototype it was like, \u201cthis was clearly designed by the same team\u201d. Both in a material standpoint and an appearance standpoint it&#8217;s a continuation of the same crew. Our software team, particularly when it comes to Android and security updates, the team that was responsible for the super, super-fast updates at Essential are here at OSOM.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s talk about advertising. How will you differentiate the brand from 800 other phone makers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to give anything away, because I&#8217;m super excited about it. I will put it this way: When we show the broader team the campaign ideas and the first drafts, people who have been at Essential from the very beginning, they\u2019re like, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t we do that before?&#8221; We have to spend on marketing to differentiate. A big chunk of that money that we raised is going towards marketing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What can we expect on the spec-side?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a flagship device, both in terms of hardware and software.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it difficult keeping the price down for a first piece of hardware?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not really. The team that I brought over from Essential, when it comes to supply chain, is some of the best in the world. Our partners have been astonishingly supportive. We&#8217;ve gotten some amazing rates.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/09\/airbnb-closes-1b-round-at-31b-valuation-profitable-as-of-2h-2016-no-plans-for-ipo\/\">valued at tens of billions of dollars<\/a>. The company&#8217;s flotation will be a key event in this coming year&#8217;s technology exit market. Expect the NYSE and Nasdaq to compete for the listing, bankers to queue to take part, and endless media coverage.<\/p>\n<p>Given that that&#8217;s ahead, we&#8217;re going to take periodic looks at Airbnb as we tick closer to its eventual public market debut. And that means that this morning we&#8217;re looking back through time to see how fast the company has grown by using a quirky data point.<\/p>\n<p>Airbnb releases a regular tally of its expected &#8220;guest stays&#8221; for New Year&#8217;s Eve each year, including 2019. We can therefore look back in time, tracking how quickly (or not) Airbnb&#8217;s New Year Eve guest tally has risen. This exercise will provide a loose, but fun proxy for the company&#8217;s growth as a whole.<\/p>\n<h2>The numbers<\/h2>\n<p>Before we look into the figures themselves, keep in mind that we are looking at a guest figure which is at <em>best<\/em> a proxy for revenue. We don&#8217;t know the revenue mix of the guest stays, for example, meaning that Airbnb could have seen a 10% drop in per-guest revenue this New Year&#8217;s Eve \u2014 even with more guest stays \u2014 and we&#8217;d have no idea.<\/p>\n<p>So, the cliche about grains of salt and taking, please.<\/p>\n<p>But as more guests tends to mean more rentals which points towards more revenue, the New Year&#8217;s Eve figures are useful as we work to understand how quickly Airbnb is growing <em>now<\/em> compared to how fast it grew in the past. The faster the company is expanding today, the more it&#8217;s worth. And given recent news that the company has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/airbnb-lost-100-million-in-q2\">ditched profitability<\/a> in favor of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/airbnbs-q1-loss-more-than-doubled-new-data-shows\">boosting its sales and marketing<\/a> spend (leading to sharp, regular deficits in its quarterly results), how fast Airbnb can grow through higher spend is a key question for the highly-backed, San Francisco-based private company.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the tally of guest stays in Airbnb&#8217;s during New Years Eve (data <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/01\/02\/airbnb-from-1400-guests-on-new-years-eve-2009-to-over-3-million.html\">via CNBC<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JonErlichman\/status\/1079772695087251456\">Jon Erlichman<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/news.airbnb.com\/how-airbnb-is-working-to-protect-you-this-holiday-season\/\">\u00a0Airbnb<\/a>), and their resulting year-over-year growth rates:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2009: 1,400<\/li>\n<li>2010: 6,000 (+329%)<\/li>\n<li>2011: 3,1000 (+417%)<\/li>\n<li>2012: 108,000 (248%)<\/li>\n<li>2013: 250,000 (+131%)<\/li>\n<li>2014: 540,000 (+116%)<\/li>\n<li>2015: 1,100,000 (+104%)<\/li>\n<li>2016: 2,000,000 (+82%)<\/li>\n<li>2017: 3,000,000 (+50%)<\/li>\n<li>2018: 3,700,000 (+23%)<\/li>\n<li>2019: 4,500,000 (+22%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In chart form, that looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1928282\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?w=597\" alt=\"\" width=\"597\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=132,150 132w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=264,300 264w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=768,874 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=597,680 597w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=1349,1536 1349w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=1799,2048 1799w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/airbnb-new-years-data.png?resize=44,50 44w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about a few things that stand out. First is that the company&#8217;s growth rate managed to stay over 100% for as long as it did. In case you&#8217;re a SaaS fan, what Airbnb pulled off in its early years (again, using this fun proxy for revenue growth) was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/02\/01\/the-saas-travel-adventure\/\">far better than a triple-triple-double-double-double<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Next, the company&#8217;s growth rate in percentage terms has slowed dramatically, including in 2019. At the same time the firm managed to <em>re-accelerate<\/em> its gross guest growth in 2019. In numerical terms, Airbnb added 1,000,000 New Year&#8217;s Eve guest stays in 2017, 700,000 in 2018, and 800,000 in 2019. So 2019&#8217;s gross adds was not a record, but it was a better result than its year-ago tally.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the gray space in between.
