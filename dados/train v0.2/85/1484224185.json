I saw it on Facebook and noticed he had several #jeffreestar tattoos. I wanted you to see this and all of us can keep his friends and family in our thoughts.\"\n\nStar shared the GoFundMe page on his Twitter account saying he was \"devastated to hear of the passing of someone from Michigan who lived their life fearlessly and was taken too soon.\"\n\nFans pointed out that Star didn't just share the page, but donated $20,000 toward the funeral expenses with the comment, \"I love you. Rest in peace angel.\"\n\nBacon went missing on Christmas Eve after he went to meet a man he met on Grindr, a dating app, according to MLive.\n\nBacon's body was found Saturday at a home in Bennington Township. The homeowner is a 50-year-old man in custody at Shiawassee County Jail suspected of open murder, said Lt. David Kaiser of Michigan State Police.\n\nThe case is still under investigation.\n\nMore news on freep.com:\n\nMissing 25-year-old Michigan man found dead in Shiawassee County\n\nGold coins worth $1,500 each dropped into Salvation Army kettles\n\nContact Bisma Parvez: 313-222-6420 or bparvez@gannett.com Follow her on Twitter @bismapar", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jeffree Star donated $20,000 after he was tagged in a post on Twitter about a fan who was murdered in Michigan.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "YouTube artist Jeffree Star donates $20,000 for Michigan man's funeral", "description": "Jeffree Star donated $20,000 after he was tagged in a post on Twitter about a fan who was murdered in Michigan.", "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/30/youtuber-jeffree-star-donates-20-k-toward-michigan-mans-funeral/2773311001/", "site_name": "Detroit Free Press", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/04/03/USAT/d3474379-56fa-4e0a-adf2-e3772f88f792-GTY_624070882.JPG?crop=1995,1122,x0,y59&width=1995&height=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1995, "height": 1122}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bisma Parvez", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Jeffree Star donated $20,000 after he was tagged in a post on Twitter about a fan who was murdered in Michigan.", "fb": {"pages": 13642915529, "app_id": 185931034751252}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/04/03/USAT/d3474379-56fa-4e0a-adf2-e3772f88f792-GTY_624070882.JPG?crop=1995,1122,x0,y59&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@freep", "creator": "@freep", "title": "YouTube artist Jeffree Star donates $20,000 for Michigan man's funeral", "description": "Jeffree Star donated $20,000 after he was tagged in a post on Twitter about a fan who was murdered in Michigan."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/30/youtuber-jeffree-star-donates-20-k-toward-michigan-mans-funeral/2773311001/"}
