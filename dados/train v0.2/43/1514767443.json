Kay Ivey said Wednesday she would not consider any gaming compact with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians before a group brings her \u201cthe facts\u201d on the potential impact of gambling in Alabama.\n\nIn an interview with reporters on Wednesday morning, Ivey said she was reluctant to join efforts in the Alabama Legislature to come up with a settlement of lottery and gambling issues before getting a sense of the financial return such a settlement might bring.\n\n\u201cAnytime I ask people how much money the lottery would bring in, they say \u2018I think about \u2026,\u2019\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the facts to make a decision.\u201d\n\nBut the sponsor of a lottery bill in the House said he still planned to pursue the measure in the current session, saying the November presidential election was the best possible chance to pass it.\n\n\"I'm going to give it a couple of weeks before I introduce it,\" said House Ways and Means General Fund chair Steve Clouse, R-Ozark. \"But I'm still going to introduce it. Hopefully next week at this time we'll sit and talk.\"\n\nIvey also defended her plan to contract with private companies to build and lease three new men\u2019s prisons. The governor said the \u201cexecutive branch\u201d had to take the lead after the Legislature failed to pass bond issues for new prisons in 2016 and 2017. She blamed those failures on legislators\u2019 concerns about the local impact of closing prisons.\n\n\u201cThe Legislature took two sessions to deal with floating a bond issue for prisons,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth times it failed. You can\u2019t blame legislators because they don\u2019t want to lose utility payments that\u2019s in their district because of the prison.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Ivey also repeated calls in her State of the State for voters to approve a constitutional amendment that would replace the current elected State Board of Education with one appointed by the governor, which she argues could lead to better outcomes. The governor also appeared to defer to the Legislature on any policy changes to address overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons, which has led to her prison construction plan.\n\nDemocratic and Republican legislators before the session appeared interested in pursuing a state lottery and possibly a settlement of issues between the Poarch Band, who operate casinos in Atmore, Montgomery, and Wetumpka, and dog tracks like VictoryLand in Macon County and GreeneTrack in Greene County.\n\nClouse's lottery proposal would split funds between the state\u2019s pre-kindergarten program and a fund to help pay college tuition.\n\nClouse estimates the lottery would bring in $167 million \u2014 roughly 2% of the state\u2019s $7.1 billion budget. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians has also suggested a grand gambling plan could bring upwards of $1 billion into the state.\n\nIvey on Tuesday announced the formation of a working group, which she said would aim to get hard numbers on the impact of gambling. She said Wednesday has not met with the Poarch Band about a compact and said she spoke with Clouse yesterday about her proposed working group.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Steve, I\u2019m not asking you to withdraw your bill. I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019m going to do, and I invite you to consider what I\u2019m going to do, and maybe join me,\u2019\u201d Ivey said. \u201c'If it turns out like you think it will, it will be a stronger case for you.'\u201d\n\nClouse confirmed the conversation but said he thought the lottery proposal had been gone over.\n\n\"I don't see where there's any reason to put the lottery in the study,\" he said. \"There's 45 other states that have studied it.\"\n\nThe governor said she expected a report by the end of the year. \u201cBut if they get through sooner, that\u2019ll be fine too,\u201d she said.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Del Marsh, R-Anniston, said Tuesday he wanted to a see a report within the next six months. Clouse said he wanted to get his measure on the ballot this year.\n\n\"The November election when we're voting for resident is the highest turnout,\" Clouse said. \"I think that's where it ought to be.\"\n\nMore:Ivey calls for prison overhaul, cools gambling talk in State of State\n\nIvey does not have a constitutional role in a lottery amendment, which would go straight to the voters if approved by the Alabama Legislature. But she would be responsible for negotiating a compact with the Poarch Band.\n\nAsked if she was skeptical about the benefits of gambling, Ivey said \u201cPhilosophically, there is a principle in public policy that says never fund an essential service of government with an unsteady source of funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a fair statement,\u201d she said.\n\nThe proposed prison construction would erect three new men\u2019s facilities, holding upwards of 4,000 inmates. Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn has pushed for new facilities for years, arguing that most current prisons are beyond their useful life and unable to provide the programming needed to combat recidivism. But legislators in the past have balked at the price tag and the potential cost.\n\nIvey said Wednesday she would let the Legislature decide any sentencing reform proposals but said construction would come from her office.\n\n\u201cAs far as building the buildings, there\u2019s not a role for them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to build and lease and payback, what role do they have? We\u2019re doing this through the executive branch working with the Legislature. We\u2019ve got a multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted solution.\u201d\n\nProposals for construction are due on April 30. Candidates to build the prisons could be selected later this summer.\n\nIvey also urged a vote to approve Amendment 1 on March 3. The Alabama Republican Party opposes the measure, and experts aren\u2019t sure that it would lead to better outcomes. But Ivey said maintaining \u201cthe same structure\u201d of education would not do anything to raise Alabama\u2019s test scores.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d invite anybody who\u2019s concerned about the challenge of education in the future in the state to be for something very positive to improve education,\u201d she said.\n\nContact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The governor said she would expect a working group looking at the potential impact of gambling in the state to report by the end of the year.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Gov.
