Followed categories will be added to My News.\n\nBillionaire Mark \u00adCuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies \u201cnothing more than a scam\u201d.\n\nIn October, a company called Eterneva \u2013 which claims to turn loved ones\u2019 ashes into diamonds \u2013 appeared on ABC\u2019s Shark Tank in the US.\n\nThe founders convinced Mr Cuban to buy 9 per cent of the business for $US600,000 ($A859,650).\n\nBut shortly after the episode aired, gemologist Grant Mobley claimed to Page Six Style that the company was not what it seemed.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame to see that Cuban agreed to invest in Eterneva,\u201d Mr Mobley, who is also head of US trade for the Diamond Producers Association, said at the time.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Eterneva that claim to make synthetic diamonds out of human ashes have been around for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cBut after further research into the process, it has become well known within the jewellery industry that these companies are nothing more than a scam.\u201d\n\nMark Cuban is standing by the company. Picture: Elsa/Getty Images/AFP\n\nMr Mobley claimed there was no way there could be enough carbon left after a cremation to make a diamond \u2013 so when grieving families pay \u201cmuch more than the cost of a natural diamond of the same size and quality\u201d for rocks from Eterneva and companies like it, they\u2019re \u201cleft with a synthetic diamond that has no value and no ties to the ashes of a loved one\u201d.\n\nBut now the billionaire investor \u2013 who has an estimated net worth of $US4.1 billion \u2013 has returned fire, telling Page Six \u201cthe technology is backed by rock-solid science\u201d.\n\nThe company told the publication it had worked with multiple third-party chemistry labs, and tests had shown \u201con average (there\u2019s) 1 to 4 per cent carbon content (in the ashes), which is more than enough to grow a diamond\u201d.\n\nCuban said despite the controversy, \u201cone of the deals I was most excited about closing from this season of Shark Tank is \u00adEterneva\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in their product \u2026 I\u2019m such a fan that I decided to get my wife Eterneva diamonds for Christmas. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Eterneva,\u201d he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on the New York Post and was reproduced with permission\n\nOriginally published as US rich-lister Mark Cuban defends synthetic diamond company Eterneva", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Getty Images Inc.", "synthetic diamond", "New York Post Company", "United States of America", "billionaire investor", "diamond company", "gem expert", "California", "synthetic diamonds", "Mark Cuban", "North America", "third-party chemistry labs", "Agence France Presse", "Diamond Producers Association", "Northern America", "jewellery industry", "Grant Mobley", "Oli Coleman", "Shark Tank", "grieving families pay", "America", "synthetic diamond company", "claim diamond company", "Laguna Beach"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Oli Coleman", "December"], "publish_date": "Sun Dec 29 23:48:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Billionaire Mark \u00adCuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies \u201cnothing more than a scam\u201d.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/wp-content/themes/newscorpau-news-dna/dist/images/favicons/heraldsun-16x16.png", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "robots": "noarchive", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "application-name": "heraldsun", "google-site-verification": "IArUmMtd-imYEJILabVqwWZGQg-b9v8krfJxAJNmB1c", "description": "Billionaire Mark \u00adCuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies \u201cnothing more than a scam\u201d.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=392582225, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/au/app/herald-sun/id392582225", "fb": {"app_id": 252020266266901}, "keywords": "Getty Images Inc.,synthetic diamond,New York Post Company,United States of America,billionaire investor,diamond company,gem expert,California,synthetic diamonds,Mark Cuban,North America,third-party chemistry labs,Agence France Presse,Diamond Producers Association,Northern America,jewellery industry,Grant Mobley,Oli Coleman,Shark Tank,grieving families pay,America,synthetic diamond company,claim diamond company,Laguna Beach", "article": {"publisher": "Herald Sun", "author": "Oli Coleman", "publicationdate": "2019-12-29T23:48:00.000Z", "section": "News", "published_time": "2019-12-29T23:48:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2019-12-30T00:59:58.000Z"}, "ob": {"article_type": "NON_PREMIUM"}, "articleid": "a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theheraldsun", "title": "Billionaire\u2019s company slammed as a \u2018scam\u2019", "description": "<p>Billionaire Mark &shy;Cuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies &ldquo;nothing more than a scam&rdquo;.</p>", "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9053f5612167c4d6e65119223bd761fb"}, "og": {"site_name": "heraldsun", "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "US rich-lister Mark Cuban defends synthetic diamond company", "description": "Billionaire Mark \u00adCuban is punching back against a gem expert who called one of his companies \u201cnothing more than a scam\u201d.", "category": "News", "url": "https://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/companies/us-richlister-mark-cuban-defends-synthetic-diamond-company-eterneva/news-story/a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a", "image": {"identifier": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9053f5612167c4d6e65119223bd761fb", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/us-richlister-mark-cuban-defends-synthetic-diamond-company-eterneva/news-story/a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/us-richlister-mark-cuban-defends-synthetic-diamond-company-eterneva/news-story/a8481a16f867c6aa258a5bff3106993a"}
