Democrats have urged Senate Republicans to force witnesses to testify in the trial; however, Republicans have floated calling witnesses from which the Democrats don't want to hear.\n\nGiuliani's overseas actions have been a big part of the case against the president. He conducted an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He has also been looking into the younger Biden's work with Ukrainian company Burisma, which faced allegations of corruption while the elder Biden was still in office.\n\nThe president encouraged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to work with Giuliani and to open an investigation into his political foe. The call set off impeachment proceedings in the House, which culminated last month with Trump becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News", "Impeachment", "Ukraine", "Rudy Giuliani", "President Trump"], "tags": ["President Trump", "Ukraine", "Impeachment", "News", "Rudy Giuliani"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 13:22:31 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "pages": "page", "app_id": 190451957673826}, "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "keywords": "News,Impeachment,Ukraine,Rudy Giuliani,President Trump", "brightspot.contentId": "0000016f-6123-d066-a7ff-e36345ae0000", "og": {"title": "Giuliani says he&#39;d testify in Senate impeachment trial and offers to &#39;try the case&#39;", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-hed-testify-in-senate-impeachment-trial-and-offers-to-try-the-case", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cfaf2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cfaf2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "secure_url": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cfaf2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/png", "alt": "Rudy Giuliani"}, "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "site_name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/mike-brest", "published_time": "2020-01-01T13:22:31.881", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T14:24:14.694", "section": "News", "tag": "Ukraine"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said he'd be willing to testify in the Senate's impeachment trial of the president and added that he would like the opportunity to try the case himself.", "image": {"identifier": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/851bf37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1288+0+20/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Fea%2Ff985ce9743c2b74c333bbbe08b8a%2Frudyg.jpg", "alt": "Rudy Giuliani"}, "site": "@DCExaminer", "title": "Giuliani says he&#39;d testify in Senate impeachment trial and offers to &#39;try the case&#39;", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "brightspot.cached": "true", "dy": {"url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-hed-testify-in-senate-impeachment-trial-and-offers-to-try-the-case"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-hed-testify-in-senate-impeachment-trial-and-offers-to-try-the-case"}
