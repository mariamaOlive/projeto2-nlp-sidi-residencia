Gretchen Whitmer ordered that all gatherings of 250 people or more be canceled or postponed.\n\nUnder the executive order, which was to begin at 5 p.m. Friday, all events and gatherings of more than 250 people are temporarily prohibited in the state. Certain events are exempt from this prohibition, such as industrial or manufacturing work, mass transit, or the purchase of groceries or consumer goods.\n\nWhile high school, college and major league sporting events have all already been canceled, the new order could affect some church services this weekend and many churches had already canceled Sunday Mass.\n\n\u201cThis is about protecting the most people we can from the spread of coronavirus,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cMy administration will continue to do everything we can to mitigate the spread, and to ensure our children, families and businesses have the support they need during this time. We are going to get through this, but we must be flexible and take care of each other.\u201d\n\nMore:Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: All Michigan K-12 schools must close until April 5\n\nMore:Amid coronavirus concerns in jail, there's nowhere to avoid the crowds\n\nThe order came about 12 hours after Whitmer ordered all schools to shut down through April 5. The number of cases has grown to 16 in Michigan as of Friday afternoon and the state is awaiting results from another 26 suspected cases.\n\n\u201cProhibiting large assemblages is the smart thing to do to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief deputy for health and chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that everyone in Michigan follow these orders and make smart choices that will slow the spread of the virus, including practicing good hygiene and social distancing. We will continue to work with the governor and our partners across state government to protect Michigan families and businesses.\u201d\n\nOne of the events that was canceled by Friday afternoon was the annual Boat Show at the Suburban Collection Showplace in Novi.\n\n\"The situation today is much different than it was two days ago when we decided to move forward with the Progressive Novi Boat Show,\" the sponsors of the show said on its website. \"In light of the new developments surrounding the coronavirus, the MBIA Board has decided to cancel the remaining 3 days of the Progressive Novi Boat Show.\"\n\nInformation about the outbreak is changing rapidly.
