He indicated that the goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients.1\n\n\u201cThis is a historic breakthrough,\u201d Trump said.1 \u201cIt\u2019s been a very successful method of communication, but never used on [this large of a] scale.\u201d\n\nCMS Administrator Seema Verma said the \u201cdramatic expansion\u201d will benefit the 62 million beneficiaries across the country enrolled in Medicare. Previously, she said, full telehealth services were limited to patients who met certain criteria, including those mostly in rural areas of the United States who had difficulty accessing medical care. However, these services are now accessible in more homes and in a variety of care facilities.1", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "payer", "retail", "HSE", "telehealth"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kristen Coppock", "Ma", "Managing Editor"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients.", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#075175", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients.", "keywords": "coronavirus,payer,retail,HSE,telehealth", "og": {"url": "https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/medicare-expanding-telehealth-services-to-all-beneficiaries-amid-covid-19-pandemic", "title": "Medicare Expanding Telehealth Services to All Beneficiaries Amid COVID-19 Pandemic", "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmacytimes/1219c69fc57a78245722b0e5e5c97141876a8772-644x390.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format", "site_name": "Pharmacy Times", "description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Medicare Expanding Telehealth Services to All Beneficiaries Amid COVID-19 Pandemic", "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmacytimes/1219c69fc57a78245722b0e5e5c97141876a8772-644x390.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format", "site": "@Pharmacy Times", "description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/medicare-expanding-telehealth-services-to-all-beneficiaries-amid-covid-19-pandemic"}
