There should be some room heaters too,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some kept themselves warm by lighting bonfires on the sidewalks, dense fog blanketed the city on Wednesday with the night temperature falling to 2.4 degrees Celsius (36.3 degrees Fahrenheit), disrupting road, air and rail traffic.\n\nOn Monday, the Indian capital recorded its coldest December day since 1901, with the maximum temperature plummeting to the lowest ever at 9.4C (48.9F).\n\n\u201cThe maximum temperature also dipped to less than 10 degrees in large parts of northern India,\u201d Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre in New Delhi told Al Jazeera.\n\nApart from the capital, Indian states and territories that continued to face a severe cold wave included Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\u201cUsually temperature dips in the month of January, but this time mercury has broken the record of decades in December itself,\u201d Shrivastava added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Gallery", "Asia", "India"], "tags": ["Science & Technology", "Coronavirus"], "authors": ["Tawqeer Hussain Nasir Kachroo", "Tawqeer Hussain", "Nasir Kachroo"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon_aje.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "keywords": "Gallery, Asia, India", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/ia_markup/gallery/2020/1/1/in-pictures-indias-homeless-bear-brunt-of-record-cold"}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/1/1/in-pictures-indias-homeless-bear-brunt-of-record-cold", "title": "In Pictures: India\u2019s homeless bear brunt of record cold", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ee139679271e408b92c1c503cb82e60d_8.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630", "description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless."}, "twitter": {"account_id": 5536782, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/1/1/in-pictures-indias-homeless-bear-brunt-of-record-cold", "title": "In Pictures: India\u2019s homeless bear brunt of record cold", "description": "Capital New Delhi broke record for coldest December day in 119 years on Monday, compounding miseries of the homeless.", "image": {"src": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ee139679271e408b92c1c503cb82e60d_8.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630", "alt": "In Pictures: India\u2019s homeless bear brunt of record cold"}}, "pageSection": "gallery,Gallery", "pageAuthors": "Tawqeer Hussain,Nasir Kachroo", "pageType": "Article Page", "taxonomy-tags": "Gallery"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/1/1/in-pictures-indias-homeless-bear-brunt-of-record-cold"}
