A \"Last Night in Havana\" party theme is planned for New Year's Eve before Latido closes.\n\nBut the spot won't be closed for long.\n\nOwners Joe and Cari Vaughn said the space at the corner of John R and Hamata will return to its roots as Joebar on January 7. With its neighborhood feel, Joebar also returns with a slew of past menu favorites of dip sandwiches like the Joedip 2.0 classic French dip, Joebar cream pies and classic cocktails including the draft old-fashioned.\n\n\"Joebar was born to be a neighborhood corner spot with classic cocktails, the iconic French Dip and cream pies,\" Joe Vaughn said in an email. And that\u2019s what we can all plan on come Tuesday, January 7. \"\n\nVaughn said patrons can expect a variety of dip sandwiches including a chicken and vegetarian version.\n\nBut Cuban sandwiches lovers need not fear, Joebar will keep Latido's popular sandwich, which Free Press restaurant critic Mark Kurlyandchik deemed one of the best north of Miami, Florida. The sandwich is renamed Jose Cubano. It's ingredients \u2014 ham, pork confit, McClures sweet and spicy pickles, Swiss cheese and slathering of yellow mustard \u2014 are layered in on Cuban Roll that's pressed like a panini.\n\nThere will also be chili, fries, house made coleslaw and potato salad and a signature house chopped salad. Bar service includes a $7 draft old fashioned, draft, canned and bottled beers, canned wine and classic Joebar cocktails.\n\nAnother highlight is Joebar will return with vintage video games as well as Addams Family pinball.\n\nFirst Call is Joebar's happy hour from 4-6 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday. Specials will include half dip sandwiches and fries as well as drink specials. On Tuesdays, there is also a special of a dip sandwich and a beer for $10.\n\nAt Joebar, Wednesday nights will be a bonus night for those named Joe and derivatives of \u2014 think Joann, Joey, Josephine. From 4 p.m.-midnight, there will be rotating drink specials. On March 27, National Joe Day, a Joe party for all Joe's and friends of Joe's is planned.\n\nJoebar opened in spring of 2017 as a bar serving up dip sandwiches, beer and cocktails. Shortly after came Frame, a hidden space behind a false wall inside the restaurant that hosts guest chefs, special dinners and private events. It's accessed through Joebar and advance ticket sales.\n\n\"Joebar and Frame's mission statement has always been to create food and drink experiences, by collaborating with rotating culinary talent, \" Vaughn said. \"It's energy for everyone: Joebar, Frame and the Hazel Park neighborhood. The two spaces have always meant to complement each other.\"\n\nLatido at Joebar opened in late January 2019. Bringing the Latin inspired year-long menu concept was executive chef Michael Barrera. Latido was also overseen by chef de cuisine Moses Fishman a former sous chef at the now closed Axle Brewing's Livernois Tap. Fishman left Latido several months ago.\n\nBarrera will become Frame's chef liaison as the company continues to bring in and host chefs locally and around the country. Before Latido Barrera was culinary director for Heirloom Hospitality, the group that owns and operates Prime & Proper in Detroit and the Townhouse in Birmingham and Detroit. Moses, a former sous chef at the now closed Axle Brewing's Livernois Tap, left Latido several months ago.\n\nLast Night in Havana New Year's Eve Party features passed snacks, party favors, music by Detroit Vinyl Room's DJ Isaac Prieto and a midnight champagne toast. Tickets are $20.20 and include one drink ticket. The party starts at 8:30 p.m. A full bar will be available and will feature Latin cocktails, beer and South American wines.
