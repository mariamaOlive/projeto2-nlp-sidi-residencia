Tom Wolf has closed all schools \"indefinitely\" to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u2014 Ron Musselman can be reached at rmusselman@yorkdispatch.com or via Twitter at @ronmusselman8", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "There are already approximately 1,600 food distribution sites across the state, which is expected to increase because of the waiver.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Waiver allows all Pa. schools to provide free meals to children during coronavirus crisis", "description": "There are already approximately 1,600 food distribution sites across the state, which is expected to increase because of the waiver.", "url": "https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/2020/03/31/waiver-allows-all-pa-schools-provide-free-meals-children-during-coronavirus-crisis/5093175002/", "site_name": "York Dispatch", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/16/PPYD/3b68881e-b890-42ca-924a-3313ce34843d-200316_BK_lunch_program_covid_3.jpg?crop=1999,1124,x1,y106&width=1999&height=1124&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1999, "height": 1124}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Ron Musselman", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "There are already approximately 1,600 food distribution sites across the state, which is expected to increase because of the waiver.", "fb": {"pages": 73274315816, "app_id": 137865502956416}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/16/PPYD/3b68881e-b890-42ca-924a-3313ce34843d-200316_BK_lunch_program_covid_3.jpg?crop=1999,1124,x1,y106&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@YorkDispatch", "creator": "@YorkDispatch", "title": "Waiver allows all Pa. schools to provide free meals to children during coronavirus crisis", "description": "There are already approximately 1,600 food distribution sites across the state, which is expected to increase because of the waiver."}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.yorkdispatch.com/story/news/local/2020/03/31/waiver-allows-all-pa-schools-provide-free-meals-children-during-coronavirus-crisis/5093175002/"}
