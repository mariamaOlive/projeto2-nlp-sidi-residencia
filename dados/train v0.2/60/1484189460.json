The Knox County Sheriff's Office determined that no crime had occurred.\n\nThe student also named Chuck Ngyuen, a social worker at the high school, in the lawsuit for not reporting the allegations of abuse to authorities.\n\nThe woman said she told Nguyen about the various \"gifts\" the former principal was giving her and Nguyen said Cavanaugh was being \"nice\" to her.\n\nBetween April 2017 and November 2017, Cavanaugh and the student exchanged about 5,000 text messages, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe school and Nguyen did not return a request for comment. Cavanaugh could not immediately be located for comment.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "WALDOBORO, Maine (AP) \u2014 A former Maine high school principal is being accused of repeatedly sexually harassing a female student in a recent lawsuit. \n The now 19-year-old woman filed a complaint Frid\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Ex-principal accused of sexually harassing female student", "description": "WALDOBORO, Maine (AP) \u2014 A former Maine high school principal is being accused of repeatedly sexually harassing a female student in a recent lawsuit. \n The now 19-year-old woman filed a complaint Frid\u2026", "url": "https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2019/12/31/ex-principal-accused-of-sexually-harassing-female-student/1982490007/", "site_name": "Seacoastonline.com", "image": "https://www.seacoastonline.com/tangstatic/sites/npoh/og-image-q1a2z3f0a631d4.png", "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Staff Writer", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "WALDOBORO, Maine (AP) \u2014 A former Maine high school principal is being accused of repeatedly sexually harassing a female student in a recent lawsuit. \n The now 19-year-old woman filed a complaint Frid\u2026", "fb": {"pages": 10153249920871122, "app_id": 1689412007891012}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@seacoastonline", "creator": "@seacoastonline", "title": "Ex-principal accused of sexually harassing female student", "description": "WALDOBORO, Maine (AP) \u2014 A former Maine high school principal is being accused of repeatedly sexually harassing a female student in a recent lawsuit. \n The now 19-year-old woman filed a complaint Frid\u2026"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.fosters.com/story/news/2019/12/31/ex-principal-accused-of-sexually-harassing-female-student/1982490007/"}
