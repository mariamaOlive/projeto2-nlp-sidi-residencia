She\u2019s an author, oral historian and media producer specializing in race and ethnic relations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing about diversity, for many, many years now in terms of racial interactions and cross cultural interactions,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI began interviewing people as a way to collect their stories of race, ethnic relations and experiences over time.\u201d\n\nOliver, 72, grew up in Jacksonville and said she was one of the first black freshmen to attend the University of Florida in 1965. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in English from UF and went on to receive master\u2019s in creative writing from Florida International University and her doctorate in the Comparative Studies Public Intellectuals Program at Florida Atlantic University, focusing on race and ethnic communication.\n\n\u201cFrom interviewing people and training students we were able to gather what became an archive of 125 interviews, from a cross section of white, black, Hispanic, Asian and Caribbean cultures,\u201c Oliver said.\n\nWhat began as personal exploration turned into a lifelong journey.\n\n\u201cI think that I\u2019m a product of my time,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI came of age when the Civil Rights Act was passed. I was one of those first group of people who walked through that door into the new world.\u201d\n\nThe free program is family oriented and open to all ages.\n\n\u201cIt certainly could be a time for people across generations to learn and see how their history now ties in with the past and that we\u2019re all on the same continuum,\u201d said Oliver.\n\nWHO: Kitty Oliver studies and writes about racial and cross cultural interactions.
