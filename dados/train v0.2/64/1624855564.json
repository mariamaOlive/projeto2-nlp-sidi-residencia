Chris, in my opinion, was the most popular among us, who had a way of drawing every eye to what he was doing on stage. As an incredibly trained dancer, he would pick up an entire dance number in a matter of minutes; something that would take us days. I truly envied him as a performer.\u201d\n\nJesse added: \u201cWe were a part of something people never get to experience in an entire lifetime at the tender ages of 12 and 14. Although we were a band for only 3 years, at that age, it feels like a lifetime and we built a real brotherhood. In later years, we would grow apart as our lives would take different turns, but I would often reflect on our early days together and think about how exciting it all was.\u201d\n\nJeese concluded his post by sending his love to Chris\u2018 mom.\n\n\u201cMy deepest sympathies go out to his mother whom I know cherished him dearly,\u201d Jesse wrote. \u201cRIP Chris. I\u2019ll never forget your smile. #DreamStreet #ChrisTrousdale\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Chris Trousdale", "JJ Links Around The Web", "Jesse McCartney"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jun  3 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jesse McCartney Mourns Death of Dream Street Bandmate Chris Trousdale, Says He Was \u2018Explosively Charming\u2019 Jesse McCartney is remembering his late Dream Street bandmate Chris Trousdale.
