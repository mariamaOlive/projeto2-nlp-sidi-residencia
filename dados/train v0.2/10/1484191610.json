Few gave the Wolverines a chance to beat the Crimson Tide. Yet they held a 16-14 halftime lead and trailed by just five points entering the fourth quarter.\n\nMichigan's early play gave it a shot at upsetting Alabama. But the Wolverines' offense was shut out in the second half, piling up yardage but not paying it off with points. And while Michigan's defense made some plays, the Crimson Tide's explosive pass game could not be neutralized.\n\nThe key sequence: a 14-yard completion to star receiver Jerry Jeudy on third-and-11 from Alabama's 8-yard line, followed by a 58-yard completion to Jeudy and then a 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Miller Forristall that extended the Crimson Tide's lead to 12 points.\n\nAlabama scored 35 points on just 55 plays, with an explosive mix of calls that helped it rack up 480 yards. Meanwhile, the Wolverines reached midfield on seven drives \u2014 with only one touchdown and 16 points to show for it despite 388 yards of total offense (285 of which came in the first half).\n\nMichigan's first-half play was promising, especially with how the Wolverines responded following a three-and-out on their opening possession and Alabama's subsequent 85-yard touchdown pass to Jeudy on its first play.\n\nOffensive coordinator Josh Gattis dialed up several inventive plays, and the offensive line helped generate 135 first-half yards rushing as Michigan controlled the line of scrimmage. Meanwhile, Alabama punted three consecutive possessions after the opening score.\n\nThe Wolverines kicked three field goals in the first half, including 57-yarder from Quinn Nordin, who tied the program and Citrus Bowl records. Before Nordin's kick, which came as time expired in the second quarter, Alabama scored a touchdown after a roughing-the-passer penalty extended the drive.\n\nThe Crimson Tide got the ball first in the second half and struck quickly, going 75 yards in four plays after a 42-yard touchdown strike from Alabama quarterback Mac Jones to receiver Devonta Smith. Jones, who replaced injured starter Tua Tagovailoa earlier this season, completed 16 of 25 passes for 327 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nJones struggled with his accuracy and uncorked some wild passes, and Michigan's Shea Patterson wasn't effective throwing deep. The Wolverines took plenty of downfield shots, but did not connect on a single deep ball. Patterson completed 17 of 36 passes for 233 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nMichigan remained within striking distance until Jeudy took over in the fourth quarter, with catches of 14 and 58 yards.\n\nThere were some positives for Michigan, which acquitted itself well against a loaded Alabama roster. And yet, Michigan has now lost its final two games for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nBeating the Crimson Tide wouldn't have erased last month's blowout loss to Ohio State at Michigan Stadium. But it would've meant something for the Wolverines, who wanted to prove that they could beat college football's elite, even in non-playoff bowl game.\n\nContact Orion Sang at osang@freepress.com.
