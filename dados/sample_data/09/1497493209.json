It was only on March 20 that the government announced that Cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants, etc. must close.\n\nBut during the weekend, large groups of people can still be seen in some parks and tourist hot spots, prompting concerns that many people might be ignoring the government\u2019s advice of avoiding social contact.\n\nThis is in addition to the fact that the growth of UK\u2019s COVID-19 cases is still substantial.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there had been 6,650 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK, an increase of 967 in the past 24 hours, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care. A total of 335 COVID-19 patients had died, the figures showed.\n\n\u201cWithout a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won\u2019t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,\u201d said Johnson.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FGicon.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@Mandy Jackson", "site": "@MandyJa82022964", "title": "UK introduces stricter measures to fight COVID-19", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Monday evening a series of measures that aim to restrict social contact in the United Kingdom, so as to curb the spread of COVID-19.Johnson made the", "image": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Boris1.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.0.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FGicon.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "http://famagusta-gazette.com/2020/03/24/uk-introduces-stricter-measures-to-fight-covid-19/"}
