This is no longer feasible and their lives are now in dire danger.\n\n\u201cThis pressed situation might throw up unforeseen vicissitudes of grave implications if nothing is done to avert same. We, therefore, use this medium to make the following urgent demands to Mr President that:\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Youth and Sports should be included in the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to enable him coordinate outreach to youths in terms of awareness and welfare.\n\n\u201cThere should be an immediate and direct release of relief materials and funds to all the 37 State Chapter Chairmen of the National Youth Council of Nigeria for onward distribution to the Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cNigerian youths should be fully and properly integrated into the activities of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for faster and efficient results.\n\n\u201cMay we reiterate that Nigerian youths are already dying slowly under the biting pangs of hunger and this must be stopped through proper concerted efforts,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nNIGERIAN TRIBUNE", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr  2 18:40:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NYCN has appealed to the FG to include its members in palliative measures as they are the major groups hit by the shutdown of the economy.....", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "NYCN has appealed to the FG to include its members in palliative measures as they are the major groups hit by the shutdown of the economy.....", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19: NYCN makes case for youths in FG's palliatives \u00bb Coronavirus", "description": "NYCN has appealed to the FG to include its members in palliative measures as they are the major groups hit by the shutdown of the economy.....", "url": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/covid-19-nycn-makes-case-for-youths-in-fgs-palliatives/", "site_name": "Tribune Online", "updated_time": "2020-04-03T17:57:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NYCN.jpg", "secure_url": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NYCN.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 350}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Tribuneonline/", "section": "Coronavirus", "published_time": "2020-04-02T18:40:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-03T17:57:12+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1050738235033475, "pages": 77912203638}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "NYCN has appealed to the FG to include its members in palliative measures as they are the major groups hit by the shutdown of the economy.....", "title": "COVID-19: NYCN makes case for youths in FG's palliatives \u00bb Coronavirus", "site": "@nigeriantribune", "image": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NYCN.jpg", "creator": "@nigeriantribune"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "//331746-1018445-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logo.jpg", "numberOfItems": 3, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}, "canonical_link": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/covid-19-nycn-makes-case-for-youths-in-fgs-palliatives/"}
