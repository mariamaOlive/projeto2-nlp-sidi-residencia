If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can,\" he said.\n\n\"If you don't follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.\"\n\nThe decision follows Friday's announcement that all pubs, restaurants and gyms should shut down, then the continuation of commuters packing into trains on Monday, and of sun-seekers crowding into parks over the weekend.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Breaking News", "lockdown", "strict", "police"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "PanARMENIAN.Net - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown in the country, with a ban on gatherings", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/web/premier/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "UK bracing for strict lockdown to be enforced by police", "description": "PanARMENIAN.Net - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown in the country, with a ban on gatherings", "keywords": "Breaking News, lockdown, strict, police", "news_keywords": "Breaking News, lockdown, strict, police", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 Day", "og": {"title": "UK bracing for strict lockdown to be enforced by police", "site_name": "The UK News", "url": "https://www.theuknews.com/news/264409391/uk-bracing-for-strict-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police", "description": "PanARMENIAN.Net - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown in the country, with a ban on gatherings", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/pan1585033632.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theuknews", "title": "UK bracing for strict lockdown to be enforced by police", "description": "PanARMENIAN.Net - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will order police to enforce a strict coronavirus lockdown in the country, with a ban on gatherings", "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/pan1585033632.jpg"}}, "canonical_link": "http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/279375/"}
