The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.\n\nCommunity transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. It refers to the difficulty in grasping the epidemiological link in the community beyond confirmed cases. This is different from the local transmission which means that the source of the infection has been identified within the reporting location (such as within a country, region or city).\n\nAccording to the ICMR, a total of 5,911 people have been tested who had respiratory diseases but did not have coronavirus. Of these, 102 people were found who had coronavirus and 40 of them had no contact history. Such patients were found in 36 districts spread across 15 states in the country. These states need to be careful\n\nNo such case was found initially in this study that took place in March but such cases were found in April. To monitor community transmission in the country, ICMR is conducting tests of people who are not patients of coronavirus but patients of respiratory diseases i.e. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nSo far, a total of 1,44,910 samples from 1,30,792 individuals was tested and 5,705 individuals have been confirmed positive among suspected cases and contacts of known positive cases in India. On April 9, till 9 pm (IST), 16,002 samples and of these, 320 were tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nAs of April 9, 5,734 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 166 deaths have been reported in the country. 473 persons have been cured or discharged after recovery.\n\nThe ICMR has also elaborated on the strategy for testing COVID-19 across the country especially in hotspots and evacuees centres identified by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).\n\nIt has directed that in the hotspots, cluster areas, large migration gatherings and evacuees centres, all symptomatic ILI (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose) will have to be tested within seven days of illness (rRT-PCR) and after 7 days of illness, an antibody test (if negative, confirmed by rRT-PCR) will be done.\n\nFor the rest of the country, the testing strategy is--all symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days, all symptomatic contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, all symptomatic health care workers, all patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath) and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day five and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "india lockdown", "Coronavirus deaths", "Coronavirus positive cases", "COVID-19 deaths", "COVID-19 positive cases"], "tags": ["Narendra Modi", "Coronavirus positive cases", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus deaths", "COVID-19 positive cases", "8447 Confirmed 765 Discharged 273 Deaths Full coverage", "COVID-19 deaths", "india lockdown"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr  9 23:15:27 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/images/logo/zeenewslogo_favico_32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "verify-v1": "90soTS2GMMKllaVY8vtJNQKzGSgcoEhkVtoFlmAwpOw=", "news_keywords": "Coronavirus,COVID-19,india lockdown,Coronavirus deaths,Coronavirus positive cases,COVID-19 deaths,COVID-19 positive cases", "description": "The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.", "keywords": "Coronavirus, COVID-19, india lockdown, Coronavirus deaths, Coronavirus positive cases, COVID-19 deaths, COVID-19 positive cases", "fb": {"app_id": 1911135012435337}, "og": {"site_name": "Zee News", "type": "article", "title": "ICMR study points towards possible community transmission of coronavirus COVID-19 in India", "url": "https://zeenews.india.com/india/icmr-study-points-towards-possible-community-transmission-of-coronavirus-covid-19-in-india-2275178.html", "description": "The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.", "updated_time": "2020-04-10T01:02:17+05:30", "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2020/04/09/853824-community.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@zeenews", "creator": "@zeenews", "url": "https://zeenews.india.com/india/icmr-study-points-towards-possible-community-transmission-of-coronavirus-covid-19-in-india-2275178.html", "title": "ICMR study points towards possible community transmission of coronavirus COVID-19 in India", "description": "The study shows that one-third of the people in India contracted the infection without any contact with the infected person and with no travel history to a foreign nation.", "image": {"src": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2020/04/09/853824-community.jpg"}}, "article": {"tag": "COVID-19 positive cases", "published_time": "2020-04-09T23:15:27+05:30", "modified_time": "2020-04-10T01:02:17+05:30"}, "theme-color": "#2196f3"}, "canonical_link": "https://zeenews.india.com/india/icmr-study-points-towards-possible-community-transmission-of-coronavirus-covid-19-in-india-2275178.html"}
