The society recently met officials from National Museums NI to discuss its ambitions.\n\nSociety committee member Kevin Carson said the official status would enable it to loan and swap artefacts with other museums throughout Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe started in one room and then we took over a second room and now we have a third room and, even at that, we haven\u2019t enough space to put on show all the stuff we have,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do look forward to getting museum status. Me and other members of the committee have travelled the length and breadth of Ireland to tie up with other groups and museums and collectors to hope in the future to actually exchange parts of our exhibitions back and forward, so stuff from Belfast could be on show in Cork or Mayo or Derry or Donegal, but we need to have proper museum status.\n\n\u201cWe are going through the process at the moment with meeting all the groups that would be great assistance to us to turn ourselves into a museum.\u201d\n\nThe Roddy McCorley Society was formed in 1972 as a vehicle to raise funds for the families of republican prisoners.\n\nThe collection of artefacts began with art crafted by those prisoners, such as Celtic crosses and leather wallets.\n\nWhile the society tells the story of the Troubles very much through a republican prism, the collection also includes several loyalist items, donated by ex-prisoners from the other tradition who have visited as part of peace process reconciliation initiatives.\n\nMr Carson said Gadafy\u2019s shoes were \u201cvery valuable\u201d and continued to generate significant interest among visitors. A TV crew from the Middle East visited during the summer to film Mr Carson recounting the story of the shoes.\n\n\u201cJoe Cahill, one of our major republican personalities over the years, had been in Libya on a number of occasions to meet Gadafy and on one of the occasions he met Muammar Gadafy in the desert after a great long journey in the sun and heat and dryness, because Gadafy in those days could never stay in one spot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJoe on that occasion was presented by Muammar Gadafy with these slippers as a souvenir of this visit.\u201d\n\nThe director of National Museums NI, Kathryn Thomson, said: \u201cThe story of our recent past is one that is distributed through a network of museums, visitor attractions, and tours across Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cAt National Museums NI we work with this network as part of the development and programming of important exhibitions such as the Troubles & Beyond at the Ulster Museum.\n\n\u201cWhere relevant we are always willing to offer curatorial and other expert advice and support to community led initiatives.\n\n\u201cWithin this context we welcomed the opportunity to visit the Roddy McCorley Museum recently and look forward to seeing their project develop.\u201d \u2013 PA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Artefacts include shoes reputedly owned by Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gadafy", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/assets/images/favicons/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "description": "Artefacts include shoes reputedly owned by Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gadafy", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom14128171"}, "news_keywords": "News, Joe Cahill, Kathryn Thomson, Kevin Carson, Muammar Gadafy, Roddy Mccorley, Belfast City Council, British Army, Irish Republican Army, Belfast, Libya, Northern Ireland", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "all", "og": {"title": "Belfast society seeks to get museum status for Troubles collection", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/belfast-society-seeks-to-get-museum-status-for-troubles-collection-1.4128171", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Artefacts include shoes reputedly owned by Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gadafy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128170&origw=1440", "secure_url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4128170&origw=1440", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IrishTimes", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/belfast-society-seeks-to-get-museum-status-for-troubles-collection-1.4128171", "title": "Belfast society seeks to get museum status for Troubles collection", "description": "Artefacts include shoes reputedly owned by Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gadafy", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128170.1577878547!/image/image.jpg", "account_id": 15084853}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "fb": {"pages": 45441411157, "app_id": 1170474839675514}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/belfast-society-seeks-to-get-museum-status-for-troubles-collection-1.4128171"}
