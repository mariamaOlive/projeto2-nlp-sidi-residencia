Stores and restaurants will have to limit customers to half capacity, and you\u2019re encouraged to wear a mask if you go out.\n\nThe order allows houses of worship to reopen next Friday \u2014 all other mass gatherings are limited to 25 people. Bars, gyms and casinos are still closed. Holcomb says if everything goes well, the plan is to go back to normal on the Fourth of July.\n\nBut Marion and Lake Counties remain under full lockdown for another week, and Cass County for two weeks. Nearly half the state\u2019s coronavirus cases are in those three counties.\n\nFor additional information, visit backontrack.in.gov.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["stay at home order", "coronavirus", "Gov.
