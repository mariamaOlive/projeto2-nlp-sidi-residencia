   "articleBody":"Chandigarh With the Union health ministry declaring Chandigarh a Covid-19 hotspot (red zone), the UT administration has decided to test all those with Influenza like Illness (ILI) for the virus. Also, the administration  decided to start thermal scanning on city&rsquo;s border of all the people entering the city.The administration has decided to adopt the testing protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research which was updated on April 9.UT&rsquo;s principal secretary, health, Arun Kumar Gupta, said the patients with ILI &mdash;a person suffering from fever, cough, sore throat and running nose &mdash; will be tested for the virus.&ldquo;It is as per the protocol developed by ICMR that persons with ILI should be tested within seven days of developing the illness and it will be adopted in Chandigarh in the same manner,&rdquo; he said.Regarding the other condition of ICMR which says that after 7 days of illness, the test should be repeated using anti-body test and if it is negative, it should be reconfirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, he said it will not be required at the moment as they should be able to conduct the test within the 7 days of the illness.Earlier the protocol for testing involved symptomatic patients who have undertaken an international travel, and the contacts of the confirmed cases. Later, it was extended to patients with severe acute respiratory illness.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the tests will conducted as per the policy framed by the UT administration and it will be adopted by all city institutes.NO&thinsp;FRESH&thinsp;CASE&thinsp;FOR&thinsp;FOUR&thinsp;DAYSMeanwhile, the city reported no fresh case for the fourth consecutive day, while 17 people of a joint family were quarantined in Sector 15.

Results are awaited.Meanwhile, the police department has been provided with the 60 thermal scanners for examining  people entering the city. In the review meeting, the administration also decided that all the staff of municipal corporation, including vendors, vehicle drivers, sanitation workers etc. must be medically screened, sanitised and provided safety gears.The permissions granted to all the online home delivery agencies would stand cancelled if they failed to follow similar measures stipulated for the MC staff. Cooked food home delivery services will continue to be banned. Also, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida held discussion with Punjab and Haryana governments to run their offices in Chandigarh with minimal staff, since the entire city has been declared as hotspot district and is under curfew.RELAXATIONS CITY SET TO MISS AFTER APRIL 20From April 20, additional activities will be allowed &ldquo;to mitigate hardship on the public&rdquo; in the country except areas under red zone.
