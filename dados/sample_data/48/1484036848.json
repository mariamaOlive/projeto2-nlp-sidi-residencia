Failure to do so could have consequences, he said, citing the mass movement of migrant labour that has already taken place.\n\n\u201cAnother would be people defying the lockdown to get back to work if they cannot survive otherwise. Spending on the needy at this time is a high priority use of resources, the right thing to do as a humane nation, as well as a contributor to the fight against the virus,\" Rajan said in his blog posted on LinkedIn.\n\nThe economist, however, said that India cannot, at the same time, lose sight of its financial constraints. Unlike developed economies such as the US or Europe, which can spend 10% of GDP without fear of a ratings downgrade, India has entered this crisis with a huge fiscal deficit, and will have to spend even more, he said.\n\nA ratings downgrade coupled with a loss of investor confidence could lead to a plummeting exchange rate and a dramatic increase in long-term interest rates in and substantial losses for India\u2019s financial institutions, he said.\n\nMany economists have been urging the government to come out with a fiscal stimulus package to salvage the economic growth rate and save jobs, arguing factory closures and a lockdown are set to take a heavy toll on economic growth.\n\nAccording to Shamika Ravi, director of research at Brookings India, India need not wait any longer before announcing a big fiscal stimulus package. \u201cWe should be prepared for a strategy of \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to fight back the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy. That means, we should be having a response that works out to 4-5% of GDP. Our initial response\u2014the welfare package\u2014was very humanitarian in nature. Overall, given the uncertain nature of the pandemic, we will have to frontload the economic response,\" she said. \u201cIndia cannot afford to wait for long to get clarity on the impact of the pandemic before announcing the economic response.\"\n\nRajan, who had previously served as chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, also warned that bad loans will mount in the banking sector, including in retail loans as unemployment rises.\n\n\u201cThe RBI should consider imposing a moratorium on financial institution dividend payments so that they build capital reserves,\" he said.\n\nHe suggested that the government accept responsibility for the first loss in incremental bank loans made to small businesses, up to the quantum of income taxes paid by such entities in the previous year. This, Rajan argued, will recognize the likely future contribution of small businesses to the exchequer and reward them with easier access to funds.\n\nHe recommended the strong measures as the coronavirus pandemic has affected jobs and businesses in a bigger way than even the shock caused by the global financial crisis of 2008-09. He said that with the right resolve and priorities, however, India could take control over the situation and set the stage for a better future.\n\nThe three-week lockdown, he said, is the first step, which buys India time to improve its preparedness. \u201cWe should now plan for what happens after the lockdown, if the virus is not defeated. It will be hard to lock down the country entirely for much longer periods, so we should also be thinking of how we can restart certain activities in certain low-infection regions with adequate precautions,\" he said.\n\nRajan also urged the government to take the support of people with proven expertise and capabilities to manage the situation. \u201cIt may even want to reach across the political aisle to draw in members of the opposition who have had experience in previous times of great stress like the global financial crisis,\" he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Raghuram Rajan", "Narendra Modi administration", "Narendra Modi", "Coronavirus", "covid-19", "Raguram Rajan on Coronavirus"], "tags": ["Start-Up Diaries", "NRI Investment Queries", "Narendra Modi", "Mint Explainers", "Brand Masters", "Mint Views", "Digital Gurus", "Annual Banking Conclave", "Mint 50 - Top Mutual Funds", "Money With Monika", "Market Analysis", "India Investment Summit", "Budget Videos", "Yes Bank Crisis", "Raghuram Rajan", "5G Tech", "#WFHLife", "Money With Monika, Season 3", "Coronavirus", "Long Story Capsule", "Plain Facts", "Business of Entertainment", "Mint Insight", "Coronavirus outbreak", "Long Reads", "Foldable Smartphones", "Why Not Mint Money"], "authors": ["Gireesh Chandra Prasad"], "publish_date": "Sun Apr  5 22:05:37 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Former RBI boss warns that bad loans will mount in the banking sector.The pandemic is India\u2019s greatest emergency perhaps since Independence, says Raghuram Rajan", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://images.livemint.com/rw/PortalConfig/LiveMint/static_content/images/v2/livemint_favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Former RBI boss warns that bad loans will mount in the banking sector.The pandemic is India\u2019s greatest emergency perhaps since Independence, says Raghuram Rajan", "keywords": "Raghuram Rajan,Narendra Modi administration,Narendra Modi,Coronavirus,covid-19,Raguram Rajan on Coronavirus", "news_keywords": "Raghuram Rajan,Narendra Modi administration,Narendra Modi,Coronavirus,covid-19,Raguram Rajan on Coronavirus", "og": {"title": "Prioritize spending on poor, Raghuram Rajan tells Modi", "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/04/05/600x338/68913c22-5a34-11ea-946a-b28d7a578122_1586104377334_1586104473263.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rajan-urges-modi-to-prioritise-spending-on-poor-cautions-about-rise-in-bad-loans-11586103660943.html", "site_name": "Livemint", "description": "Former RBI boss warns that bad loans will mount in the banking sector.The pandemic is India\u2019s greatest emergency perhaps since Independence, says Raghuram Rajan"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Prioritize spending on poor, Raghuram Rajan tells Modi", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@livemint", "domain": "livemint.com", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rajan-urges-modi-to-prioritise-spending-on-poor-cautions-about-rise-in-bad-loans-11586103660943.html", "title": "Prioritize spending on poor, Raghuram Rajan tells Modi", "description": "Former RBI boss warns that bad loans will mount in the banking sector.The pandemic is India\u2019s greatest emergency perhaps since Independence, says Raghuram Rajan", "image": {"src": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/04/05/600x338/68913c22-5a34-11ea-946a-b28d7a578122_1586104377334_1586104473263.jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-04-05T22:05:37+05:30", "section": "News", "tag": "Narendra Modi"}, "author": "Gireesh Chandra Prasad", "Last-Modified": "2020-04-05T23:24:53+05:30", "Last-Modified-Date": "Sun, Apr 05, 2020", "Last-Modified-Time": "2020-04-05T23:24:53+05:30", "storyid": 11586103660943, "section": "News", "last-updated": "2020-04-05T23:24:53+05:30", "screen-name": "story"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/rajan-urges-modi-to-prioritise-spending-on-poor-cautions-about-rise-in-bad-loans-11586103660943.html"}
