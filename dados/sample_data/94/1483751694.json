Developing a coronavirus vaccine may turn into an ideological race between the world\u2019s leading powers, says a collective statement of the Belgrade Forum for the World of Equals, an organization of Serbian diplomats, political scientists, and military and medical officers, obtained by TASS Thursday. \"With a few exceptions, humanity did not show any significant feats of solidarity in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, [humanity\u2019s] western part \u2014 especially so,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe organization\u2019s representatives expressed their concerns that a \"race to find a vaccine\" would begin soon, which may turn into an ideological war. \u201cThose who find the vaccine first, will have more success convincing others that his vaccine is better than [that of] the others.\" According to the experts, it is possible that \"propaganda, not the vaccine\u2019s quality, will shape\" the balance of world powers after the pandemic. The Belgrade Forum for the World of Equals is an expert club, created in 2000 that analyses events in Serbia, in the Balkans and throughout the entire world. It is currently presided over by one of its co-founders, former Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zivadin Jovanovic. Earlier, Serbian Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Affairs Zoran Djordjevic told TASS that Serbian authorities do not rule out a second wave of the coronavirus infection until a vaccine is found. The total coronavirus case count in Serbia is 8,724, the total fatality count is 173. Serbia has completely sealed off its borders, introduced a state of emergency and a curfew, and cancelled its parliamentary elections.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Specialists all over the world work on almost 119 vaccine projects, out of which only nine projects from Canada, the US, China and the UK advanced to the clinical testing stage", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "/img/blocks/common/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"description": "Specialists all over the world work on almost 119 vaccine projects, out of which only nine projects from Canada, the US, China and the UK advanced to the clinical testing stage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "yandex-verification": "f91ce7b4a203a30a", "google-site-verification": "PoyFi2APBqKw8uGePodmFqId646DYLqqS1qiMTh153w", "msvalidate.01": "C05302AEC20336D89FE678451D9C5CDC", "fb": {"app_id": 755370384546299, "pages": 144698628932572}, "og": {"site_name": "TASS", "type": "article", "image": "https://phototass1.cdnvideo.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20200430/1265133.jpg", "url": "https://tass.com/society/1151917", "title": "COVID-19 vaccine development may turn into an ideological race, say experts", "description": "Specialists all over the world work on almost 119 vaccine projects, out of which only nine projects from Canada, the US, China and the UK advanced to the clinical testing stage"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@tass_agency", "id": 285532415}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "COVID-19 vaccine development may turn into an ideological race, say experts", "description": "Specialists all over the world work on almost 119 vaccine projects, out of which only nine projects from Canada, the US, China and the UK advanced to the clinical testing stage", "image": "https://phototass2.cdnvideo.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20200430/1265133.jpg"}, "vk": {"image": "https://phototass3.cdnvideo.ru/width/1074_8f2dea56/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20200430/1265133.jpg"}, "gtm-page-type": "news"}, "canonical_link": "https://tass.com/society/1151917"}
