Norman Oliver, M.D., M.A. \u201cThe health of our residents and the community is our top priority, and we will continue working together to care for the patients, protect the safety of health care workers, and protect the people in our Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nThe Peninsula Health District has activated its incident management team and is deploying all necessary resources in order to contain the outbreak in the area, according to the Virginia Department of Health. Public health officials are reaching out to all identified contacts of every known COVID-19 case, including the case involving the man's death.\n\nThey are interviewing affected people and giving instructions on how to protect themselves and others.\n\nAs of Saturday, forty-one patients have tested \"presumptive positive\" or positive for COVID-19 in Virginia.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health has been updating its total number of cases once per day, around noon. On Saturday, the total rose to 41 cases, up from 30 cases on Friday, 17 cases on Thursday and 9 cases on Wednesday.\n\nThe total reported by VDH includes both presumptive positive cases \u2013 COVID-19 tests that came back positive either at the Virginia state lab or commercial labs but haven't yet been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) \u2013 and confirmed positive cases, which have been confirmed by the CDC.\n\nRecent days have brought increased coronavirus testing capacity for Virginia, with the state lab in Richmond receiving more testing kits and many hospitals, including Sentara RMH, gaining access to testing through commercial labs. That means more reported cases were expected as more people gained the ability to be tested.\n\nOn Thursday, the first positive test was reported in the Shenandoah Valley for a Harrisonburg patient that had been hospitalized at Sentara RMH after developing pneumonia-like symptoms.\n\nSince then, there have no other confirmed cases in the western part of the state.\n\nThe VDH provided the following breakdown of locations for all 41 cases reported as of Saturday: 10 in Fairfax County, 8 in James City County, 7 in Arlington County, 5 in Loudoun County, 3 in Virginia Beach, 2 in Prince William County, 1 in Spotsylvania County, 1 in Prince Edward County, 1 in Hanover County, 1 in Chesterfield County, 1 in Alexandria, and 1 in Harrisonburg.\n\nOn the global scale, you can find a map by Johns Hopkins University tracking worldwide confirmed numbers of cases and deaths here.\n\nGovernor Ralph Northam issued the following statement in response to the confirmed virus death:\n\n\u201cPam and I were deeply saddened to learn that a Virginian has died from COVID-19, and we grieve for everyone this virus has touched around the world.\n\n\u201cThe health of Virginians and our communities is my most important priority right now. As a Commonwealth, we have taken major, critical steps to stop the spread of COVID- 19. I have declared a state of emergency, closed K-12 schools across the state, restricted visitors at nursing homes and correctional facilities, limited state employee travel, and canceled large events.\n\n\u201cThis is a public health crisis\u2014we must all treat it as such.\n\n\u201cAgain, I urge Virginians: take this seriously. Take basic health precautions, avoid large gatherings, telework if possible, and stay home if you are sick. That will stop the virus from spreading.\n\n\u201cIt is all of our responsibility, yours and mine, to keep each other safe and healthy.\n\n\u201cYou deserve to know next steps. I will meet with local officials on the Peninsula tomorrow, and we will speak to the community at 12:00 PM about additional measures we are taking to combat COVID-19.\u201d\n\nWhat to know about COVID-19\n\nMost people don't suffer much from COVID-19, but it can cause severe illness in the elderly and people with existing health problems.\n\nThe coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can cause mild to more severe respiratory illness. In a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can cause death, particularly among those who are older or who have chronic medical conditions. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days of being exposed to an infectious person. COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nTo lower the risk of respiratory germ spread, including COVID-19, the Virginia Department of Health encourages the following effective behaviors:\n\n\u2022 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.\n\n\u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n\u2022 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n\n\u2022 Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n\u2022 Stay home when you are sick.\n\n\u2022 Avoid contact with sick people.\n\n\u2022 Avoid non-essential travel.\n\nFor the latest factual information on COVID-19, you're encouraged to check both the Virginia Department of Health and the CDC.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["VDH confirms 1st coronavirus-related death in Virginia"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Whsv Newsroom"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed the first novel coronavirus-related death in Virginia.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/228*228/310x310_WHSVFavoriteIcon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"title": "VDH confirms 1st coronavirus-related death in Virginia", "description": "The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed the first novel coronavirus-related death in Virginia.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/coronavirus+mgn8.jpg", "url": "https://www.whsv.com/content/news/VDH-confirms-1st-coronavirus-related-death-in-Virginia-568803331.html?dun"}, "description": "The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed the first novel coronavirus-related death in Virginia.", "author": "WHSV newsroom", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/WHSV.TV"}, "application-name": "", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/144*144/310x310_WHSVFavoriteIcon.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/70*70/310x310_WHSVFavoriteIcon.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/270*270/310x310_WHSVFavoriteIcon.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//media.graytvinc.com/designimages/310*310/310x310_WHSVFavoriteIcon.png", "google-site-verification": "SeTCC1UrHA660Yrcmg1WXJUJ64XrPdobHPsmWMz55O4", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 108762971134, "pages": 65714680335}, "news_keywords": "VDH confirms 1st coronavirusrelated death", "keywords": "VDH confirms 1st coronavirus-related death in Virginia", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@WHSVnews", "creator": "@WHSVnews", "url": "https://www.whsv.com/content/news/VDH-confirms-1st-coronavirus-related-death-in-Virginia-568803331.html", "title": "VDH confirms 1st coronavirus-related death in Virginia", "description": "The Virginia Department of Health has confirmed the first novel coronavirus-related death in Virginia.", "image": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/coronavirus+mgn8.jpg"}, "burst": "WHSV"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.whsv.com/content/news/VDH-confirms-1st-coronavirus-related-death-in-Virginia-568803331.html"}
