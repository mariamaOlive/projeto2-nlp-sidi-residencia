The confinement to our homes and the constant worry about our safety and that of our loved ones make us anxious, sad and often depressed. Acknowledging this, several organisations offer free counselling to help people grapple with their fears.\n\nThe Department of Psychology, Rathinam Group of Institutes\n\nCovid Mind Support is an initiative launched to provide mental and emotional support. \u201cIt is a difficult time for everyone and taking care of mental health is very important. When I suggested the idea of providing free counselling, I got a good response from my colleagues and the management. We launched the service on March 27th,\u201d says Sajeeth Kumar, head of the department. The team has seven psychologists and they provide sessions over phone calls and WhatsApp.\n\nSajeeth says that he has received nearly 20 calls so far. \u201cThe callers come from different backgrounds and most of them are older people who live alone. Some are worried about their health while others are anxious about the safety of their children living elsewhere,\u201d he says. Sajeeth advises people to limit social media activity, eat healthy and sleep for at least eight hours every day. \u201cI also recommend doing exercises and talking to family and friends,\u201d he says. Sajeeth has formed a team with his students to make memes with awareness messages on mental health that they post on their social media pages. \u201cI once got a call at 11:00 pm. The gentleman was worried and couldn\u2019t sleep and I helped him,\u201d he says. Covid Mind Support will offer its service till the pandemic settles down.\n\nCall 9500750095, 8883784546, 9942789480, 9791615880, 8608575262, 9629920112 or WhatsApp 7708019222.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Association of Clinical Psychologists\n\nThe association has volunteers assigned for every district in the state. \u201cWe have a WhatsApp group and the decision was taken following a discussion there. There are 120 volunteers across the state and and we formed teams to handle the cases,\u201d says Thamilselvan P, who works as an assistant professor in the department of psychology at PSG College of Arts and Science and is one of the five volunteers from Coimbatore.\n\nKnow your anxiety Dr K Selvaraj, Professor of Psychiatry and Chief Psychiatrist, Vazhikatti Mental Health Centre and Research Institute says that he has seen a 20% increase in the number of calls that they have been receiving in the past two weeks. \u201cSince the lockdown, we have started on-call counselling. Many callers complain about being not able to sleep, waking up tired, or experiencing palpitation, dry mouth, churning of stomach, etc. These are all signs of anxiety. This could be due to the worries about their jobs, safety or income,\u201d he says.\n\nHe suggests that people who experience any such concerns should consult a psychiatrist. \u201cAlso talk about your anxiety to your family members. The emotional and mental support that they can provide is tremendous. Try to involve yourself in physical activities. It helps you calm down and sleep better. It is also best to avoid screen time at least an hour before sleep,\u201d he recommends.\n\nThis is not a free service. Call 9842253053 from 9:30 am to 1:30 am to book an appointment.\n\nTamilselvan gets at least four calls every day and most of them are to address anxiety. \u201cThe number is gradually increasing each day. Majority of them have no history of mental illness. I listen to them and suggest ways to modify their negative thoughts,\u201d he says. The service will be provided until the pandemic settles down.\n\nCall 9842006144, 9865585987, 9003378216, 9994279271, 890345668 between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm.\n\nNG Chandran Charities of Nitya Gurukula\n\nThe organisation started free counselling from April 2. \u201cWith the entire family being together all the time, there is bound to be pressure and interpersonal conflicts,\u201d says Sudha Sundaram, COO of Nitya Gurukula. Nitya Gurukula has a team of 15 qualified counsellors who provide on-call, WhatsApp and video sessions. \u201cIt depends on the person calling. Some people are more comfortable seeing their counsellors\u2019 face while others prefer text messages. We provide them with practical tips to relax,\u201d she says. The free sessions will be available till April 14.\n\nCall 9489382307, 9500912307,1800121203040 between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm or write to info@nityagurukula.org to book an appointment.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Covid 19", "coronavirus", "coimbatore", "free counselling", "Rathinam Group of Institutes", "The Tamilnadu Association of Clinical Psychologists", "NG Chandran Charities of Nitya Gurukula"], "tags": ["Citizenship Amendment Act", "SEE ALL REPORTS", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Fact Check", "Prime Minister Narendra Modi"], "authors": ["As Many As Districts Have At Least One Case"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Three organisations in Coimbatore offer free counselling to help people deal with anxiety arising from the coronavirus pandemic", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thehindu.com/thfavicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Help is at hand as cases of anxiety stemming out of Covid-19 increase in Coimbatore", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "description": "Three organisations in Coimbatore offer free counselling to help people deal with anxiety arising from the coronavirus pandemic", "keywords": "Covid 19,coronavirus,coimbatore,free counselling,Rathinam Group of Institutes,The Tamilnadu Association of Clinical Psychologists,NG Chandran Charities of Nitya Gurukula", "news_keywords": "Covid 19,coronavirus,coimbatore,free counselling,Rathinam Group of Institutes,The Tamilnadu Association of Clinical Psychologists,NG Chandran Charities of Nitya Gurukula", "publish-date": "2020-04-09T15:27:40+05:30", "created-date": "2020-04-09T15:27:40+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-04-10T11:09:58+05:30", "twitter": {"creator": "Susan Joe Philip", "title": "Covid-19: Dealing with mental stress", "description": "Three organisations in Coimbatore offer free counselling to help people deal with anxiety arising from the coronavirus pandemic", "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/4u5woy/article31297833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEPRESSION", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@The_Hindu", "domain": "thehindu.com", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "The Hindu", "googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=584786636", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hindu", "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/help-is-at-hand-as-cases-of-anxiety-stemming-out-of-covid-19-increase-in-coimbatore/article31297834.ece", "type": "article", "title": "Covid-19: Dealing with mental stress", "description": "Three organisations in Coimbatore offer free counselling to help people deal with anxiety arising from the coronavirus pandemic", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/4u5woy/article31297833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEPRESSION", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "Susan Joe Philip", "tag": "NG Chandran Charities of Nitya Gurukula", "section": "Health"}, "msvalidate.01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2", "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "ahrefs-site-verification": "6df5b97abf2ea60f2d4123265496b92b4faa009ceff5444e0b8482ebddd508d6", "theme-color": "#fff"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/help-is-at-hand-as-cases-of-anxiety-stemming-out-of-covid-19-increase-in-coimbatore/article31297834.ece"}
