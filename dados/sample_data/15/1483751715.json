I commend them for recognising and acknowledging the error of their ways.\n\nNow, they are correcting their misstep, nearly a week after the fact, by calling up and visiting these persons to instruct them accordingly and, hopefully, to try to retrace their movements after their arrival in Jamaica.\n\nThe Government should seriously consider closing down regular activities on the island for even a week to stave off any potential spread from the likely mingling of these recent arrivals.\n\nPETER A.
