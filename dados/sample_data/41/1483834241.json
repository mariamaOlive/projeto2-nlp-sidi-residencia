Visit bars, restaurants, shopping malls, CHURCHES and demand that your schools re-open. NOW! If government doesn\u2019t stop this foolishness\u2026STAY IN THE STREETS. END GOVERNEMNT CONTROL OVER OUR LIVES. IF NOT NOW, WHEN? THIS IS AN EXPLOITATION OF A CRISIS,\u201d Clarke tweeted on Sunday.\n\nThat tweet remained up on Monday. However, Twitter had removed three of his related tweets.\n\n\u201cIt is now evident that this is an orchestrated attempt to destroy CAPITALISM. First sports, then schools and finally commercial business,\u201d he warned in one since-deleted tweet. \u201cTime to RISE UP and push back. Bars and restaurants should defy the order. Let people decide if they want to go out.\u201d\n\nClarke\u2019s first tweet, also removed, along these lines was mostly venting: \u201cI am TIRED of all this, \u2018we have to err on the side of caution\u2019 BULL SH*T. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO REASONABLENESS DAMMIT. It\u2019s the DAMN FLU. Stop being afraid and start being SENSIBLE. WASH YOUR FUCK*NG HANDS! STOP BUYING TOILET PAPER. DO YOU FUC*ING HEAR ME????\u201d\n\nIn short order, however, he shifted to figuring out a way to blame liberals for the pandemic\u2019s spread. \u201cFolks, the LEFT has collapsed our institutions that have served us in times of trouble,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTAKE \u2026 TO \u2026 THE \u2026 STREETS. That is the battlefield the LEFT has defined. I will no longer sit back and watch the destruction of this great republic over the FLU.\u201d (Twitter also deleted that tweet.)\n\nClarke\u2014who has participated in the anti-Semitic attacks on financier George Soros in the past\u2014also directed his ire at the Jewish man he believes is the \u201cpuppet master\u201d behind \u201cthe left\u201d: \u201cNot ONE media outlet has asked about George Soros\u2019s involvement in the FLU panic. He is SOMEWHERE involved in this,\u201d he tweeted Sunday.\n\nNone of this comes as a particular surprise to anyone who has followed Clarke\u2019s career. He first rose to fame in right-wing circles as a \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d closely associated with extremists such as Richard Mack and his Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, the antigovernment organization that promotes the posse comitatus-derived belief, among others, that the county sheriff is the supreme law enforcement entity in the United States.\n\nNot only is Clarke a member in good standing with the CSPOA, he was named its \u201cSheriff of the Year\u201d in 2013, and addressed its annual convention. His speech openly endorsed the organization\u2019s radical interpretation of the Constitution, and he called its members \u201cthe true patriots.\u201d Clarke also emphasized his view that \u201cour common enemy\u201d is \u201cthe government.\u201d\n\nClarke\u2019s subsequent career as a frequent guest on Fox News included segments featuring vicious attacks on President Obama, whom he claimed was attempting to foment racial unrest due to his \u201cdivisive policies,\u201d as well as accusing Obama of waging a \u201cwar on cops.\u201d He was especially vicious in his attacks on black activists and the Black Lives Matter movement, describing them as \u201cscum\u201d and \u201csubhuman\u201d and calling for their eradication.\n\nEventually, after the DHS role was turned away, Fox News quietly scrubbed him from their contributor rolls.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["OpenThread", "Vote", "MitchMcConnell", "Resistance", "FoxNews", "Elections", "Patriotmovement", "GOP", "COVID19", "Democrats", "Progressives", "Populists", "2020", "Election", "Community", "trump", "Constitutionalists", "RightWingExtremism", "BlueWave", "Republicans", "Media", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Pandemic", "Covid-19", "PublicHealth", "Vote2020", "Election2020", "2020election", "BernieSanders", "Senate", "HealthCare", "DonaldTrump", "JoeBiden"], "authors": ["Daily Kos Staff", "Backgroundurl Avatar_Large", "Nickname", "Joined", "Created_At", "Story Count", "N_Stories", "Comment Count", "N_Comments", "Popular Tags"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Back when he was a regular on Fox News, then-Sheriff David Clarke\u2019s main schtick involved vicious attacks on Black Lives Matter and the progressive movement, all of which led to Donald Trump very ...", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.dailykos.com/assets/apple-icon-57x57-2e646db97f0fab741d17464bafb9305f.png", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://assets.dailykos.com/assets/browserconfig-f98c7975cea63ad1f13eadb54713dc5a.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.dailykos.com/assets/ms-icon-144x144-22fe2dc9a64d090749ea1a9421924d5f.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709, "pages": 243155501243}, "og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "type": "article", "title": "Ex-Sheriff Clarke urges far-right followers to 'take to the streets,' defy coronavirus measures", "url": "https://www.dailykos.com/story/2020/3/16/1928016/-Ex-Sheriff-Clarke-urges-far-right-followers-to-take-to-the-streets-defy-coronavirus-measures", "image": "https://images.dailykos.com/images/577839/story_image/GettyImages-1009283294.jpg?1534359226", "description": "Back when he was a regular on Fox News, then-Sheriff David Clarke\u2019s main schtick involved vicious attacks on Black Lives Matter and the progressive movement, all of which led to Donald Trump very ..."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@dailykos", "title": "Ex-Sheriff Clarke urges far-right followers to 'take to the streets,' defy coronavirus measures", "image": {"src": "https://images.dailykos.com/images/577839/story_image/GettyImages-1009283294.jpg?1534359226"}, "description": "Back when he was a regular on Fox News, then-Sheriff David Clarke\u2019s main schtick involved vicious attacks on Black Lives Matter and the progressive movement, all of which led to Donald Trump very n..."}, "description": "Back when he was a regular on Fox News, then-Sheriff David Clarke\u2019s main schtick involved vicious attacks on Black Lives Matter and the progressive movement, all of which led to Donald Trump very ...", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dailykos.com/story/2020/3/16/1928016/-Ex-Sheriff-Clarke-urges-far-right-followers-to-take-to-the-streets-defy-coronavirus-measures"}
