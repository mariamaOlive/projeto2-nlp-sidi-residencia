It could be Spurs, or another club,\u201d he told Belgian TV channel Play Sports. \u201cI really want to continue at top level for a few more years and I would like to play European football next season.\n\n\u201cSince January, a number of clubs have come forward with serious proposals. The Spanish and Italian leagues are the most obvious for the time being, but I will keep all options open.\u201d\n\nThe Belgium defender, who has been in and out of the team this season, has revealed he finds himself in a stronger position because of the affect the coronavirus could have on the game.\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m free, of course, and many clubs don\u2019t have the money to do transfers. Transfer-free players like me are even more coveted in the coronavirus crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Premier League are still working out a way to end the season, with some leagues around Europe beginning to accept defeat in their bid to complete the campaign.\n\nA centralised camp to play all of the games in several weeks is just one suggestion which has been mooted, but Vertonghen says that would be \u201cdramatic\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey will do everything to finish the competition and people are even considering quarantining the players, coaches and referees for five weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a kind of mini-World Cup. That would be dramatic for a family man like me. But we players have little say about that. Money talks.\u201d\n\nPA", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Jan Vertonghen", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur |", "Jan Vertonghen", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Jan Vertonghen |"], "authors": ["Sports Staff"], "publish_date": "Thu Apr 23 12:36:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Jan Vertonghen has hinted for the first time he will leave Tottenham Hotspur when his contract expires.
