Photo: AFP\n\n\u201cIt was correct to keep schools open, but as of now, I think if we want to do a circuit breaker properly, we should close schools\u201d as well, Ong said.\n\nFrom this week, Singapore is to shutter its schools as it moves to full home-based learning.\n\nIt was one of a handful of regions that had resisted doing so, citing early research that children are not as affected as adults, even when more than 160 countries had already shut their schools.\n\nThe decision to suspend schools and also close most workplaces came as confirmed cases of local transmissions and unlinked infections in the city-state have risen in the past few weeks.\n\nAs of Monday, Singapore reported a total of 1,375 cases since the outbreak began. On Sunday, the city-state announced 120 new cases, by far its highest single-day tally.\n\nWhile Ong said that about 65 students have been infected with the virus so far, none of them caught the disease while attending school, but from traveling or from the adult family members in their households.\n\nSchools and some businesses may reopen by May 4 if the circuit breaker measures are successful, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we do it right, if everyone cooperates, we should be able to crash the transmission rate,\u201d Ong said. \u201cI really hope we do this successfully, and by the fourth of May, we can reopen some business outlets, we can reopen schools, and life gets back to a certain normalcy again.\u201d\n\nTrade-reliant Singapore is reeling from the impact of the pandemic, with the government predicting a 1 to 4 percent contraction in the economy this year.\n\nThat was even before new restrictions on movement begin today.\n\nOng said the virus has all but forced productivity to come to a halt.\n\n\u201cActivity stops, so the impact on GDP will be tremendous\u201d this month, he said.\n\nOn Monday, Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat (\u738b\u745e\u5091) announced the country\u2019s third stimulus package in two months.\n\nCosting S$5.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), it brings the city-state\u2019s total virus relief to almost S$60 billion, or 12 percent of GDP, and includes cash payouts to individuals as well as additional steps to save jobs.\n\nThe fiscal measures are meant to help companies survive, ensure they have cash flow and help people to pull through this period, Ong said.\n\nWith general elections that must be held by April next year, Ong said there is a \u201cgood chance\u201d that Singaporeans might have to go to the polls amid the outbreak.\n\nThe government yesterday introduced a bill in parliament, allowing for the implementation of temporary arrangements to ensure the safety of voters, candidates and election officials if elections happen under the current conditions.\n\n\u201cLife still goes on. We still go about our daily lives and democracy still has to go on,\u201d Ong said. \u201cIf we can get the virus in control, I think we can still have an election campaign plus voting in a safe way.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["\u53f0\u5317\u6642\u5831", "The Taipei Times"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Apr  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Singapore defended its decision not to close its schools earlier as the city-state goes into a partial lockdown from today to stem the spread of COVID-19.\r\nIt was the \u201ccorrect\u201d move to leave them open, as young people do not seem to be as affected by the virus as adults, while there is no evidence they are vectors of transmission, Singaporean Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung (\u738b\u4e59\u5eb7) said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \r\nShutting the schools now is part of a slew of so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d measures to shrink the transmission rate of the virus, he said.\r\n\u201cIt was correct", "meta_lang": "", "meta_favicon": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TT04.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Virus Outbreak: Singapore defends not closing schools earlier - Taipei Times", "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2020/04/08/P04-200408-322.jpg", "description": "Singapore defended its decision not to close its schools earlier as the city-state goes into a partial lockdown from today to stem the spread of COVID-19.\r\nIt was the \u201ccorrect\u201d move to leave them open, as young people do not seem to be as affected by the virus as adults, while there is no evidence they are vectors of transmission, Singaporean Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung (\u738b\u4e59\u5eb7) said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \r\nShutting the schools now is part of a slew of so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d measures to shrink the transmission rate of the virus, he said.\r\n\u201cIt was correct", "url": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2020/04/08/2003734220", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "\u53f0\u5317\u6642\u5831,The Taipei Times", "news_keywords": "\u53f0\u5317\u6642\u5831,The Taipei Times", "description": "Singapore defended its decision not to close its schools earlier as the city-state goes into a partial lockdown from today to stem the spread of COVID-19.\r\nIt was the \u201ccorrect\u201d move to leave them open, as young people do not seem to be as affected by the virus as adults, while there is no evidence they are vectors of transmission, Singaporean Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung (\u738b\u4e59\u5eb7) said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \r\nShutting the schools now is part of a slew of so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d measures to shrink the transmission rate of the virus, he said.\r\n\u201cIt was correct", "article": {"section": "World News", "published_time": "2020-04-08T00:00:00+08:00"}, "ltn": {"device": "R"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204610739643846}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2020/04/08/2003734220"}
