Japan has confirmed more than 11,000 infections of the virus with over 250 deaths.\n\nHaving to stay home and being unable to train properly has been a challenge but he is savouring being able to spend more time with his family.\n\n\u201cRight now, I think football becomes a secondary thing,\u201d added Iniesta, who scored the winning goal for Spain in the 2010 World Cup final.\n\n\u201cWhat is important right now is people\u2019s lives, people\u2019s jobs, trying to move society forward to get out of this situation.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, of course as a professional footballer it is difficult to not be able to play football, to not be able to share time with my fans, my team mates.\n\n\u201cI try to focus on the positive things, staying at home I get to spend much more time with my family and with my kids, which normally it is not that easy to do.\u201d\n\nAfter a 16-year spell at Barcelona that saw him win nine La Liga and four Champions Leagues titles, Iniesta decided to take up a new challenge in the J.League.\n\nHis storied career and that move to Japan are the subject of a documentary about his life: \u2018Andres Iniesta \u2013 The unexpected hero\u2019, which is to be released on Thursday.\n\nDespite winning virtually everything there is to win in Europe, Iniesta has not come to Japan to slide quietly into retirement.\n\nHe led Vissel Kobe to their first piece of silverware when they won the Emperor\u2019s Cup in January and is hungry for more success here.\n\nAfter his playing days are over he says he wants to move into coaching but will take things one step at a time.\n\n\u201cI feel I want to pursue being a coach but we will see what happens, things change on a daily basis so in a few years we don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor now, I am focusing on what I have in front of me.\u201d\n\nWhen football is given the green light to resume Iniesta wants to pick up where he left off, imparting his wisdom to Kobe\u2019s younger players and aiming for a first J.League championship.\n\nThe J.League have said it would be May at the earliest when matches can return.\n\n\u201cI want to share my experience with the young players. I think it is my responsibility too and it forms part of the big project I came here for,\u201d said Iniesta.\n\n\u201cI like to talk with them, share things with them and I also like the feeling that they can ask me questions and they are learning stuff.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus", "Andres Iniesta", "Barcelona", "Vissel Kobe", "World", "Football", "Sport"], "tags": ["Barcelona |", "Andres Iniesta |", "coronavirus", "Barcelona", "Vissel Kobe", "Coronavirus |", "Andres Iniesta", "Vissel Kobe |"], "authors": ["Jack Tarrant"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 21 12:43:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "With Spain one of the country\u2019s hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Barcelona great Andres Iniesta says he is finding it tough to watch events unfold in Europe from his new home in Japan.
