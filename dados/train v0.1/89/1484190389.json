But Kataib Hezbollah, whose commander once fought against American troops and now ranks among the most powerful men in Iraq, is also a sworn enemy of the United States, which has 5,000 or so troops and an unclear number of civilian contractors in Iraq to train security forces and prevent a jihadist resurgence. The militia would like to see the Americans driven out and Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq unchallenged.\n\nAnother part of the equation is that Iraq has been weakened by months of violent demonstrations, which have forced the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, setting off a power struggle. One target of the demonstrations has been the power wielded by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and Kataib Hezbollah may have correctly gambled that provoking the United States into airstrikes inside Iraq would divert popular passions toward anti-American actions.\n\nIraq, lacking a functioning government, now finds itself trapped in a fray over which it has little control, compelled by public indignation to denounce the American airstrikes on its territory but loath to lose the American counterbalance to Iran and its proxies. Iran, apart from its political calculations in Iraq, is also struggling under American economic sanctions and would no doubt like to make America\u2019s hostility as costly as possible for the Trump administration.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump loudly pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and imposed tough sanctions on Iran, it is hard to see what incentives he could dangle to prevent Iran and its proxies from further complicating the task of American forces in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East. The president could conceivably lessen tensions by opening some form of dialogue with Iran, whether about a possible renegotiation of the nuclear deal or resolving conflicts in Yemen or Syria.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Retaliation against an Iran-backed militia set off anti-American protests that could strengthen Iran\u2019s hand.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/vi-assets/static-assets/favicon-4bf96cb6a1093748bf5b3c429accb9b4.ico", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2020-01-01T20:16:37.000Z", "modified": "2020-01-01T20:16:37.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Trump, Donald J", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006898847, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/448f4b6d-0150-5c03-89a9-a8de4c8227c9", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/cf62a25d2f4f4c93970030d1a9368f69", "description": "Retaliation against an Iran-backed militia set off anti-American protests that could strengthen Iran\u2019s hand.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/opinion/01iranWeb/01iranWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By The Editorial Board", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/opinion/01iranWeb/01iranWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Civil Unrest,US Foreign Policy,US Military,Military,Embargoes Sanctions,Kataib Hezbollah,ISIS;ISIL;Islamic State,Iran,Iraq,Donald Trump", "pdate": 20200101, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/iraq-embassy-iran.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Shock Waves From American Airstrikes in Iraq May Have Just Begun", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/opinion/01iranWeb/01iranWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Protesters attacked the United States Embassy complex in Baghdad on Tuesday in response to American airstrikes on an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq and Syria."}, "description": "Retaliation against an Iran-backed militia set off anti-American protests that could strengthen Iran\u2019s hand."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/iraq-embassy-iran.html", "title": "Opinion | Shock Waves From American Airstrikes in Iraq May Have Just Begun", "description": "Retaliation against an Iran-backed militia set off anti-American protests that could strengthen Iran\u2019s hand.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/opinion/01iranWeb/01iranWeb-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Protesters attacked the United States Embassy complex in Baghdad on Tuesday in response to American airstrikes on an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq and Syria."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/448f4b6d-0150-5c03-89a9-a8de4c8227c9"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "PT": "article", "PST": "Editorial", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/iraq-embassy-iran.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/448f4b6d-0150-5c03-89a9-a8de4c8227c9", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/iraq-embassy-iran.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/iraq-embassy-iran.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/opinion/iraq-embassy-iran.html"}
